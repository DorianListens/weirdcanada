From the spastic anguish barrage of <a href="http://www.geographing.net/" target="_blank">Jarrett Samson</a>:

<div class="contentReview">
Nic Hughes is as close as Vancouver's underground scene has to royalty, something even a cursory glance at the staggering number of releases on his <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/isolatednowwaves/" target="_blank">Isolated Now Waves</a> label lends undeniable credence to. Never content to rest on such laurels, Hughes continues to produce great art at a pace few could muster (let alone match), and his solo project N.213's latest, <i>FXGGXTRY</i>, proves his merit yet again. While undeniable tapped from a similar vein as his work with <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2010/12/new-canadiana-shearing-pinx-live-thunder/" target="_blank">Shearing Pinx</a>, this cassette manages to deviate and define itself as a more personal and introspective work without all of that singer-songwriter bullshit that usually follows such descriptors. Soaked in anger (or anguish?), barrages of spastic, massive guitars slide sinew-tight over each other before slamming up against noisy rumbles of sound collage hum and restrained, unworldly instrumentals. To top it off, Hughes' inimitable vocals continue to put reverb-fetishists everywhere to shame. There's an ominous feeling to the whole record as if some strange current runs through its every connection, a basement tape concept album in denial. To put it simply? <i>FXGGXTRY</i> is the best N.213 release to date.
