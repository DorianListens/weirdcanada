<b>From the bent winds of <a href="http://mammothcave.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank"><u>Paul Lawton</a></u></b>:
The latest opus from Collapsing Opposites is a gem of psych-pop (poppy psych?) that sounds alien, but not alienating, quirky, but not annoying, dark but not desperate. Much of my affinity for Collapsing Opposites comes from the band leader Ryan McCormick (formerly of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theyshoothorses" target="_blank"><u>They Shoot Horses, Don't They</a></u>), who lends this record his warmth and charisma, and notably his strange vocal styling. Lyrics take the form of stream-of-consciousness monologue/rants that are layered inside of repetitive, swirling backdrops.  I could imagine an edition of <a href="http://www.lysergia.com/AcidArchives/" target="_blank"><u>Acid Archives</a></u> thirty years from now unearthing this record and freaking out over it as one of the great unheralded private-press oddities of 2010; hopefully the kids get hep to this record before then. 
[<b>Levin's Note</b>: This is proudly the first Acid Archives reference on Weird Canada. PS - You can order this lovely LP by visiting <a href="http://geographing.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank"><u>Geographing Records</a></u>!]
