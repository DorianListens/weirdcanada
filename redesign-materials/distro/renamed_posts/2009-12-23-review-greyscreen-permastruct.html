<b>From the GameBoy™-gripping hands of <a href="http://www.texturemagazine.ca" target="_blank"><u>Jesse Locke</a></u></b>:
As far as music made on old school handheld video game systems goes, GreyScreen (a.k.a. <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/sobadrecordings" target="_blank">Bart Records</a></u> founder and <u><a href="http://www.texturemagazine.ca/kevinStebner.html" target="_blank">retro pop culture fanatic</a></u> Kevin Stebner) is the Michael Jordan of Caddilacs. The Charles Bronson of Chiptune? From the immaculate Value Village bargain bin packaging to the poetic RPG-inspired song titles (and of course the 8-bit chirps, burps and bleeps that make up these 22 songs), everything about GreyScreen's debut tape reminds of a more innocent time spent agonizing over <u><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Olympics_2044_AD " target="_blank">Alien Olympics 2044 AD</a></u></i> in your parents' basement. Of course, Stebs also uses modern technology like Nanoloop and LSDJ to concoct these micro-epics, but his DIY punk rock ethos is maintained all the same. Need more proof? Check his killer cover of Black Flag's "Spray Paint" by downloading this <u><a href="http://calmdownkidder.com/records/?p=69" target="_blank">comp</a></u>. 
[<b>Levin's Note</b>: The world was so much simpler when everyone had a Gameboy™. All a we had to do was level-up and the monsters went away. How do the kids sleep at night today? Look back to the dot-matrix; listen to the trailing ends of MIDI; and always remember to keep a fairy in the jar. <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfSwOvkDLJo" target="_blank">Poppa don't hit me no mo'</a></u>.]
