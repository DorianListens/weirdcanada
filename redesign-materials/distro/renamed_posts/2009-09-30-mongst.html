"It's just some songs I recorded by myself" stated JV DUB, <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/shearingpinx" target="_blank">Shearing Pinx</a></u>'s drummer and participant in a plethora of Vancouver fringing (Black Dicks (best band-name in Canada), <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/aerosolconstellations" target="_blank">Aerosol Constellations</a></u>, <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/miasmamiasma" target="_blank">Totally Ripped</a></u>, and Shitty Weed).  A fairly humble statement considering the miasmic bludgeoning of basement doom and hellish guitar shreddery contained within <i>A Poison Stronger Than Love</i>. As bewildered and shocked as I was (and still am), it's brilliance lay in providing the type of intimacy that is addicting and shameful; we become voyeurs on the brink of some terrifying shit. Which is great, because we need unnerving music to remind us of how remarkable it is to be moved. I've searched long and hard for artifacts that carry this banner and they are few and far between; intense, serious, and <i>heavy</i>. Real heavy. Really heavy. If you listen to this cassette at night you will, and I paraphrase the wise words of rapper <u><a href="http://www.pliesworld.com/" target="_blank">Plies</a></u>: <i>go to bed real; wake up reala</i>.
