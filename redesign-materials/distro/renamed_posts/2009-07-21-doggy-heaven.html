There is a subtle brilliance to Crazy Ocean's cassette debut. Firstly, the pop sensibilities are entombed in their unique magi-distortion and spread into a cosmic psychedelic soundscape, buttering your crispy whole-wheat cassette deck. Secondly, the vocal-hollering, blistering bass lines, and general-chaos seem to coalesce into a chromed middle-earth anthem; if middle earth existed in space and was built with lazers. You see? It's the perfect combination of the digital-future and our psychedelic past. Imagine wizards writing FORTRAN and troglodytes high-fiving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool_Keith">Kool Keith</a> while driving space cadillacs and you have their live show. Except that's obviously a lie. Because they're human. And brilliant. More! More! More!
