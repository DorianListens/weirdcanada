<b>From the sub-zero-not-just-plain-zero <a href="http://www.weirdcanada.com/" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
Never has there been a more appropriate time to dive into Phil Dickau's ambient journey through the derelict channels of Edmonton, Alberta. Step outside right now and you'll enter Edmonton's absurd tundra-vortex; it's -46°C outside and I'll cry if I want to. Using a mix of concréte and synthesizer work-outs, <i>This City, And You</i> acts as a euphoric reminder to mellow out; it's a harsh world out there, and it doesn't matter how cold it is: Phil Dickau is here, standing on the edge of your mental cliff, with a synthesizer in his hands, telling you Edmonton's story (<a href="http://weirdcanada.com/?attachment_id=1638" target="_blank"><u>this actually happened</a></u>). <i>This City, And You</i> is a montage of audible simplicity; standing waves of municipal saturation and industrial escapism. Phil shreds and his record is the opposite of shred, which is why it also shreds. <s>Shred</s> mellow on, brother!
