Sharp Ends were the source of rampant rumours in our village square during 2009's adjective-fest (read: <u><a href="http://www.sledisland.com/" target="_blank">Sled Island</a></u>) and they've quickly become the talk of North America's underground after a debut single on Chicago's bozak-repellant <u><a href="http://www.hozacrecords.com/" target="_blank">HoZac Records</a></u>. With a new single on Lethbridge's beautifully curated <u><a href="http://mammothcave.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">Mammoth Cave Recordings</a></u>, Sharp Ends briefly depart from the rolling bass, bludgeonly drums, and red-line vocals to surprise us with one of the best B-sides left of Winnipeg (I've always wanted to say that!). <i>Loaded Hearts</i> will rip you into Legoâ„¢-chunks of teenage angst within seconds of launching; it's classic DIY jangle with way too much attitude tastefully balanced by top-notch laxidasical chanting and relentless guitar shreddery. This isn't to say <i>Crack Trap</i> doesn't also deliver, just in an entirely different way; <i>Crack Trap</i> tickles the inner post-punk / college-radio basement-nerd inside of every loser going Dutch and buying $100 7"s on the sly (myself (proudly) included). There are many treasures <u><a href="http://qmass.tumblr.com/post/237684391/mammoth-cave-recording-co" target="_blank">inside the Mammoth Cave</a></u>.
