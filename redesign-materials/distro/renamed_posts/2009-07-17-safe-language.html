Feral Children is the 2009 electronic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Buckley">Tim Buckley</a>; a forward-thinking, genre-hybridization of trends existing in the ethers of our musical consciousness.  Where Tim Buckley channeled jazz, folk, and psychedelia to produce "emotional bellowing from the depths of a drug vortex" (dr. lloyd - <a href="http://www.waxidermy.com">waxidermy</a>), Feral Children interpolates the fluxes of psychedelic-pop brewing on the borders of electronic music. His new songs are poppier, thicker, and voluminous; yet they conjure the same looping-pedal+drum-machine pop-lysergia present on his first album - now with more low-end, more psych, and more dance. It's a welcomed progression we rarely see on sophomore albums. A+++++++, fast shipping, will listen again.
