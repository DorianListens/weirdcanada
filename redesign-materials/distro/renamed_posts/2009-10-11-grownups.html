The early-90s caused a massive identity crisis. We can't spank our kids anymore? Generation X? Divorce? Bored teenagers started manifesting themselves in major cities as opposed to burrowing in the corners of rural-anything. Addicted to entertainment, they yearned for the kind of on-demand content the internet now provides. My generation had no fathers; we nested in the bussom of a confused media conglomerate and lost any sense of conviction. We stole from our friends and made out with boys-and-girls in public. We smoked weed in the alley and threw rocks at cats. We played music to our friends over the phone and the <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwJSyFfQmtw">conference-call</a></u> was the greatest invention ever. We had nothing to do and all the time in the world. We were aimless and bored. Which is why the Grown-Ups make me feel wistful. Their first cassette is the ultimate 90s summer-bummer,  wonderfully lost in an innocent teenage vortex of shit-culture and why-won't-she-date-me losertude. It's your basement anthem for listless junkies who just want to have fun. The Grown-Ups get it; being an adult is all about being a kid and growing up really sucks. Especially in the 90s. Brilliant.
