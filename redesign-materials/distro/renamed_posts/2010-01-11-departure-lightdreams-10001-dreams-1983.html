<b>From the cassette-gripping hands of <a href="http://www.weirdcanada.com" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
There is a universe inside the mind of Victorian <u><a href="" target="_blank">Paul Marcano</a></u> unlike anyone has or could have imagined. After self-releasing <i><u><a href="http://www.islandsinspace.com/" target="_blank">Islands in Space</a></u></i> (Paul's 1981 cosmic folk consecration to the colonization of space released under the moniker <u><a href="http://waxidermy.com/lightdreams-islands-in-space/" target="_blank">Lightdreams</a></u>), Paul seemingly disappeared into the serene pastures of Vancouver Island with only a brief mention of a new cassette available in an issue of <a href="http://www.cantorrecords.com/main/clem/" target="_blank"><u>CLEM</a></u> (Canadian List of Electronic Music). Almost mistakenly lumped in with left-field Canadian avant-gardism, <i>10,001 Dreams</i> takes a leave of absence from the ambient, synthesizer-driven visuals of <i>Islands in Space</i> to craft a wild, lysergic-filled journey into pan-delic psych and guitar workouts, stretching our understanding of pop-psych and bursting our tiny minds with visions of unfound landscapes. It is thee underground psychedelic masterpiece from Canada; released 15 years too late on a format no one cared about and relegated to absolute obscurity shortly thereafter. The cassettes were made-to-order and incredibly rare. Paul remains a visionary of human experience and is dedicated to experimenting with music and virtual reality.
