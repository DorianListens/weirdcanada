<b>From the not-so-bad vibrations of <a href="http://www.mta.ca/chma/" target="_blank"><u>James Goddard</a></u></b>:
Sometimes I imagine a future where everyone has forgotten what a guitar actually sounds like; Children brought up on a steady diet of <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/wearephoenix" target="_blank">French pop</a></u> and <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/stayali" target="_blank">Swedish 8-bit</a></u>. Eventually, current trends like lo-fi would become ailments listed in the <u><a href="http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/Research/DSMIV.aspx" target="_blank">DSM VII</a></u> with prescriptions like: 2 hours of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MiD_U4CHQ" target="_blank"><u>Kumbaya</a></u> orchestrated by battery-operated <u><a href="http://www.korg.com/Product.aspx?pd=128" target="_blank">MicroKorgs</a></u> (twice daily, with food). Things would be bad. Luckily former <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/dogdaytheband" target="_blank">Dog Day</a></u> drummer KC Spidle has strapped on a six string and stepped to the foreground to ensure such a future will never happen. Bad Vibrations play guitar music. They play the kind of three piece power-pop that begs for adjectives like dark or gloomy; and they play it well. Eschewing any kind of overt studio trickery, the members of Bad Vibrations (KC, Evan and Meg) have put together a crisp sounding record that subtly recalls that classic 90s Halifax sound. Nothing could be further from an all-electro dystopia. 
[<b>Levin's Note</b>: James forgot the positive side of an all-electro dystopia: <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRsNtNlXNLs" target="_blank">Gino Soccio</a></u> all day 'ere day.]
