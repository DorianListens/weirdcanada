<b>From the cave of earthly desires curated by <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/mammothcaverecordings" target="_blank">Paul Lawton</a></u></b>:<br>
No other band is able to convey the unease, trepidation and frustration of living within the <u><a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/dec2001/can-d22.shtml" target="_blank">booming Alberta economy</a></u> like Sharp Ends. Itâ€™s true, Calgarians live the complete opposite material circumstances of, say, the early UK Factory Records scene (heh). Yet, extremes are extremes, and the destitute Manchester of the early 80's and inane economic ante-upping of modern Alberta are equally as efficient at marginalizing the weak and powerlessness. And so emerges Sharp Ends, the voice of our discontent, music to soothe the general malaise. Their secret weapon is guitarist Danny Christiansen. Dannyâ€™s guitar skulks for the first half of "Ghosts of Chance,â€ bass and drum churning away with vocalist Chris Zajko lurking in the shadow, enveloping the room, and putting the listener into a <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtwMCflur3E" target="_blank">trance</a></u>. Waiting for its epic entrance, the guitar bursts into white light, from sepia tone to full technicolour before fading out and taking all hope with it. On "Northern Front", the guitar meanders and constantly leaves you wanting (especially the mini guitar suite at the end of the song). Sharp Ends are the real deal: so much complexity stuffed into music so simple. Everything you want in a band.
