They're young. Most of The Neighbourhood Council (now called BRAIDS) were in high-school when this album was recorded live-to-air on <a href="http://www.cjsw.com">CJSW</a> in Calgary. An amazing feat considering three out of the five tracks are over 7 minutes long. They're long, but the least bit boring or repetitive. The songs weave, transform, and flow in a brilliant, sometimes experimental, fashion. It's a mellow ride, so get comfy as you'll quickly arrive at the kind of pop album you wish you could be making now, let alone when you were 17 years old and watching Japanese animation in your parents basement (true story). The Neighbourhood Council became BRAIDS sometime this year and will be conducting a mass exodus to Montreal. I'm posting the two shorter tracks, but they'll give you the right idea.
