<b>From the shark-dog feathers of <a href="http://www.mta.ca/chma/" target="_blank"><u>James Goddard</a></u></b>:
Kingdom Shore eviscerates with tense, calculated string slashes. Ultra-violent. Tightly wound. Subtly disorienting. <i>...and all the dogs to shark</i> is a visceral listening experience; unrelenting sharp edges, protruding corners and just enough quiet. There is undoubtedly a sophisticated theoretical framework to analyze here, but that isn't the point, this album hits you on altogether different level. This is violent music. This is the soundtrack to <u><a href="http://www.officialsaw.com/" target="_blank">Saw 18</a></u>. This is the soundtrack for your next <u><a href="http://www.ufc.com/" target="_blank">UFC</a></u> viewing party.
