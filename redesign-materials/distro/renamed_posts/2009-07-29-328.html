You take someone and you push them. You push them into the spotlight of mainstream Canadian rock. College rock. That someone plays to thousands of smashed 18 year-olds trying to find themselves in a gravity-well of debauchery; it's beer gardens and they are the soundtrack to every fratt-kid's blurred existence. If you keep doing this (keep pushing), eventually your weird bassist is going trap himself in the bedroom and emerge anew with six eerie pop songs crafted by someone sailing towards their creative zenith. Wasted double-tracked solos, distorted Nintendo, chamber-folk, and Sartre are brewed together into a frothy mead worthy of the greatest basement-viking. Kanpai!
