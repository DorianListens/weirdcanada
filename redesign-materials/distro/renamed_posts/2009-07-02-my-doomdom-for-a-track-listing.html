Last year AHNA released this amazing violin+bass drone cassette (to be reviewed soon) and quickly re-emerged as a thrashy hardcore outfit. The dialectic has completed its full swing as the new CD sees the duo finding a compromise between the slow-and-low and hypertonic thrash. The searing bass-lines and feedback squall are patterned with the drummer's screaming as the songs build into 10 second cycles of drone. It's an interesting format and I'm excited to see where it goes. I was happy to catch them live during Calgary's <a href="http://www.sledisland.com">Sled Island</a> music festival and it was a definite highlight. However, I kept asking myself: how many doom groups have female singers? I like it.
