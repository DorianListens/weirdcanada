I'm glad we've decided to embrace the great aspects of New Age music. By the end of the 80s, trendsetters were growing tired of elevator drug-mart schmaltz and <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windham_Hill_Records" target="_blank">Windham Hill</a></u> compilations. It's 2010 and kids are incorporating the more ethereal and beautiful elements into all kinds of chaos; noise, ambient, and, in the case of Calgary's Memory Screen, woven-ethers and ornamental-folk. Memory Screen's debut album is ambitious and careful, unafraid to incorporate unlikely vibrational sources into its ethos (<u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te" target="_blank">concr√©te</a></u> sounds (wind, water, leaves), choirs, and non-traditional instruments)). It's the kind of record you only find in Calgary or Montreal and I really don't understand why. Surely, there must be other inspirational sources enabling basement dwellers to meander on the edge of subliminal acoustics. Wake up, Canada, and get with the new age. It's mellow.
