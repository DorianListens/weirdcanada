Andrea and Daniel, the two voodoo witchmasters branding themselves Nü Sensae, are one of the most exciting streams of punk-consciousness gestating in the west-coast. Which is why I chose <i>Three Dreams</i> as the soundtrack to the hobo fight in my parking lot. Andrea's iconic flannel-screaming accentuates the mumblings of a displaced mass left behind by <a href="http://www.marxist.com/" target="_blank"><u>unnatural poverty</a></u> while Daniel sets the dying-pace of their battle with the relentless destruction of his drum kit. The whole listening experience is soon tainted by a hobo army of undead <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombi_II"><u>Matoolians</u></a> raised from their graves by twin jabs of fried bass and fractured drum patterns; it's voodoo punk and it reanimated your annoying dead-and-beat uncle who's back to hit on your sister and borrow some money. The now-undead hobos are done fighting. They're looking for fresh meat. They hear my Nü Sensae. They are devouring my mind and tasting Nü Sensae's mutant spell running laps in my subconsciousness. This is past-tense. MMMMOooOOooOoOoOOOoORorRRrRRrrerrreeeeeeeeeEEEee.
