<div class="contentReview">
Thanks to the hard work of <a href="http://www.numerogroup.com/" target="_blank">Numero Group</a>'s Rob Sevier, the world's most epic soft-synth mumbler has been caught with a Canadian citizenship. What started with a chance pull in an Edmonton flea-market by one <b>Jon Murphy</b>, ended in a bewildering world-wide phenomenon of softness. Lewis' lone LP from 1983 is as unusual as it is delicate; an incomprehensible whispered drawl lingers above mysts of smooth-laced synthesizers and nylon guitar as Lewis croons his way through inaudible love, suffering, and mid-afternoon bliss. The confusion accelerates as you begin to dissect the record: dedications to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie_Brinkley" target="_blank">Christie Brinkley</a>, an incredible facsimile on the cover (looking surprisingly like <a href="http://www.aaronlevin.ca" target="_blank">Aaron Levin</a>), a record label named R.A.W., and a history of rip-offs and potential murders (uncovered by multiple individuals tracking members associated with Lewis' LP). In the end there are no answers. Lewis remains a mystery, with only his name (not Lewis), citizenship (Canadian), and a PO Box in Hawaii. I once found five copies in Calgary, Alberta, which makes me believe this unidentified future softness began in the heart of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta" target="_blank">wild roses</a>. But we may only wonder. Until then, enjoy the most incomprehensible album in the universe (yes, it's softer than <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2011/11/thomas-janela/" target="_blank">THOMAS</a>). If  you can transcribe the lyrics to "I Thought The World of You" I will give you a rare record. [<b>Special thanks</b> for those involved in uncovering the Lewis mystery (and laughing at me when I began to champion it): Jon Murphy, Rob Sevier, Jack Fernwood, and <a href="http://www.yogarecords.com" target="_blank">Douglas McGowan</a>].
