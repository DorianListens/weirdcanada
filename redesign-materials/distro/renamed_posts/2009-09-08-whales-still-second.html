Another deluxe CDR from <u><a href="http://www.mapkahtyah.com/patente/">Patentes</a></u> out of Quebec City. Limited to forty copies and recorded in January of 2009, <i>Still Second</i> contains three meditative entries into the experimental cosmos; varied as much as a triumvirate as the sounds emanating from its digital grooves. WHALES' strength resides in the ability to captivate your attention as you're bludgeoned with spurts of noise whilst traversing their rhythmic, ambient path. It's doubly impressive they were able to accomplish this on an entirely percussive track. My highest recommendation for fans of experimental music.
