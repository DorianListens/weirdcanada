<b>From the vault of Joni Sadler (Ottawa, ON)</b><br>
When I first heard about Fucked Corpse, I assumed that they were a grindcore band or something equally violent. What kind of pop group would choose a name like that, right? My initial judgements couldn't have been much further from the truth: this Ottawa party collective may have grown a bit more aggressive since their early days (fans of sugary lo-fi pop freakouts would do well to check out their "Apple Meat" 7" from a couple of years back), but those damn catchy hooks of theirs haven't gone anywhere. Jangly guitar riffs trade off with tambourine smashes and woozy hazes of distortion, but the gang manages to steer mercifully clear of both gratuitious hippie psych meanderings and excessive noise. There are some genuinely catchy jams here, too - "Denim Outta Here" is a straight-up singalong noise pop anthem. These dudes are too busy having a good time to worry about polishing the fuzz from their songs, and you know what? That's okay. It's time to join their party.
