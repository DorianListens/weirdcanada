Burnt puke from Montreal. I meant to write "punk" but I'm going to leave it. Why? Because the SLOBS are a larynx-shredding overload of pubescent attitude and mental retardation. It's a sickeningly youthful resonance that'll get you amped enough to jump in a garbage can and have sex with a pimp in the pursuit of creating a new definition of trashy. They're demo is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STB4s7Qhf40" target="_blank"><u><i>Stand-By-Me</i>-barf-o-rama</u></a>; a beautiful debauchery too awful to look away. You will stare, gaping and hoping to God the guttural baritone of SLOBS' frontman doesn't jump in your mouth and punch your mind. The best part? It's so straight you know the songs have to be brilliant. They're not afraid to pull the stops: pick slides, tempo changes, busted solos, and hooks. Also riffs, man. And they've got 'em. Get on their level before they put you there. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EfvvnKkLiY" target="_blank"><u>G'YEAH</a></u>.
