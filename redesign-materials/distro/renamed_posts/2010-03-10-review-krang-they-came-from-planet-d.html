With their second transmission from the heart of the black hole sunrise, Edmonton’s Krang continue their clusterfuck of stoner rock, noise-haze and squiggly electronics. The band’s debut <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/09/krang-cold-bebop/" target="_blank">self-released EP</a></u> was a voyage in its own right, but until now, they’ve never been able to bottle the total gnarlitude of the extended space jams doubling as their live shows. Happily, with the addition of fourth member Dean “The Ram” Watson on guitar, this five-song flummox released via <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/eamonmcgrath" target="_blank">Eamon McGrath</a></u>’s Cassettes Records has finally captured the experience on CD-R. Faithful followers will recognize the bass line from “Farmer” within seconds, along with Krang’s trademark echoed harmonica. Cold Bebop’s standout banger “Ships” has been re-recorded with the addition of Watson’s desolate licks, and finally “Snakes on the Brain” closes things off with some furious Danzig-on-psychedelic-fungi freak-outs.
