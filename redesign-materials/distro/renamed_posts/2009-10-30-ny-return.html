OK. I'm back. I'm sick and jet-lagged but I'm back. In fact, I've never been happier to be back in Canada. Believe it or not, I'm not that into patriotism and nationalism. I'm into geographical, political, and historical peculiarities that breed creative nuances, but I'm not into drinking Molson and going to hockey games. In any case, I was really happy to be back in Canada. And I'm even more excited to start reviewing again. Coming soon will be: VINCAT CD, Chris d'Eon cassette, Moby Dicks 7", Sharp Ends 7", Holzkopf CDR, and more treats and trinkets!
