<b>From the sensitive-thug stylings of <a href="http://www.texturemagazine.ca" target="_blank"><u>Jesse Locke</a></u></b>:
Before we get into the sweet and unassuming goodness of Cousins' slacker rock sing-a-longs, let me tell you a little bit about their <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJDLRCXR2ZM" target="_blank">ride</a></u>. Rolling in style from their native Nova Scotia, the Haligonians hit the highway this fall in a magic school bus equipped with bunk beds and fueled by vegetable oil. A radical alternative to be sure, but as it turned out their max road speeds were barely enough to bring them up hills, resulting in several late arrivals at out-of-town tour stops. That's a fitting analogy for the songwriting style of Cousin's Aaron Mangle as well, tangling up twangy Bill Callahan-inspired rambles with a classic Doug Martsch-style falsetto, while drifting through it all with an unhurried pace. In his <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/10/york-redoubt-st/" target="_blank">review of York Redoubt's s/t LP</a></u>, <u><a href="http://www.edmontonstories.ca/story/home-of-strange-records" target="_blank">Aaron "canonical" Levin</a></u> wrote about Halifax's "advanced level of pop wizardry," and there's a similar charm to these 10 tunes.
[<b>Levin's Note</b>: Cousins are definitely a Level âˆž Pop-Wizard.]
