<b>From the post-pubescent sludge of <a href="http://texturemagazine.ca/" target="_blank"><u>Jesse Locke</a></u></b>:
From The Cramps (radical) to Mates of State (barf) to the Plastic Ono Band (radical barfing), musical married couples are nothing new. However, what sets thee Grown-Ups’ Sara and Josiah Hughes apart is that they’re cuter than a pair of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdw4HPzKlgE" target="-blank"><u>bulldogs on snowboards</a></u> that know how to turn up the rock and turn down the suck. Joined by third member/producer Darrell on “dad guitar” (nice <i>Conchords</i> reference, guys), they’ve now teamed with the almighty <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/revolutionwinter" target="_blank">Bart</a></u> for tape release number two. Eight songs of angry punk sludge that sound just as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-5F_7DwPpo" target="_blank"><u>pitted</a></u> as their debut but now with more Crazy Horse guitar solos (see: opener “Meat”) and Art Brut-esque motivational meta-songs (see: “Start A Band!”). This is the soundtrack for the skateboarding video game you invented in your brain. The musical equivalent of a cherry-coke slurpee with a stolen chocolate bar tucked in the cup. The creepy-lovable cover photo rules too, but I really just wish it was a drawing of <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/10/grownups/" target="_blank"><u>Odie crossed with Jughead</a></u>.
