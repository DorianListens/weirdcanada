NBA Jam for the Sega Genesis was the second most punk sports game ever (the Mutant League series taking number uno). If you got three dunks in a row some dude yelled out "<i>HE'S ON FIIIIIRE</i>" and you burst into flames and did quad-flip slam-dunks. Weird dunks. Now imagine that basketball player is on fire, wearing fluorescent Nike's covered in time-shit and crystal-snot, death sunglasses, an 80GB ipod, hens teeth, and a jersey from Nowheresville, Ghost Beach. Take a ramshackle of insane kids in the remote recesses of Edmonton's hoodlets and have them dedicate an album to this space-streaming-intelligent basketball player and you might come close to the brilliance of The Wicked Awesomes!'s LP debut <i>Punk Holograms</i>. The album lacks any pretense and obeys no boundaries; from burnt puke-garage to psychedelic mizrahi-surf, the red-lights on your stereo will burst with wrecked synth-lines and skirt-chasing guitar-riffery. It's a beautiful pawnshop display-case of wastoid-punk. Brilliant. Amazing. Fantastic. Wicked. Awesome. A sure-shot contender for best album of 2009 on any continent.
