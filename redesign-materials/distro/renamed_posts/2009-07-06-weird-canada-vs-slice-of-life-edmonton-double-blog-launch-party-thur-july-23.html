Well, it's time to take this little blog out and into the infinity. Thankfully, I will not be making this adventure on my own. Thanks to the folks behind Edmonton's only pizza blog, <a href="http://sliceoflifeedmonton.wordpress.com">Slice of Life Edmonton</a>, Weird Canada and Slice of Life Edmonton will be having a double blog launch party with live music inside a pizza place. It will be fun, exciting, and delicious. Joins us and guests for a slice of life in Edmonton. Details below!

... WITH ...

Holzkopf (Edmonton, AB / Vancouver, BC)
Feral Children (Saskatoon, SK)
Sans AIDS (Edmonton, AB)
swwords (Edmonton, AB)

Come and celebrate the double-launch party of the century. Weird Canada, a new endeavor by musical enthusiast Aaron Levin, is an attempt at reviewing some of the sparkling commodities of the Canadian underground. On the other hand, Slice of Life Edmonton is simply a pizza blog; Edmonton's only pizza blog with a flair for the obscure and unknown.

What better way to celebrate these new projects than by discovering the sounds of the underground and eating a pizza at the same time!! Oh, did we mention it's happening at Steel Wheels?! When was the last time you ever saw a show there?
