<b>From the celestial kingdom of <a href="http://avantlard.blogspot.com" target="_blank"><u>Zachary Fairbrother</a></u></b>:
<u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/brokendeer/" target="_blank">Broken Deer</a></u> is the project of musician/artist Lindsay Dobbin, formerly of Halifax, now relocated in the deep, northern frontier of the Yukon. <i>Our Small Going</i> is a collection of beautiful songs mixed with field recordings, soundscapes, and lo-fi blips and bleeps, finding the perfect home on San Francisco's <u><a href="http://www.gandhararecordings.org/" target="_blank">Gandhara Recordings</a></u>. Lindsay's music is embedded with grainy sound pieces and field recordings to create a celebration of nature, ritual, life and decay. The opening track “Coming of Age Funeral” is a beautiful instrumental piece, played on a <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Primitivism" target="_blank">solo acoustic guitar</a></u> with tape hiss and buzz, giving the music a warm maternal feeling, while also tragic, as in the passing of an era or the sadness that comes with moving on. Neither ancient nor modern, the music seems to celebrate the difficulties and conveniences of our journey in the age of technology. Her textures are always light, often just using single instruments, allowing her to explore the fabrics of her sounds. Her unique voice shines through, giving a deep sense of ecology to her music.
