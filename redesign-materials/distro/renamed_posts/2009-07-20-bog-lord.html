It's precious that a folk record can prove to be most metal recording I've heard. My problem with metal is that I went to a Christian Junior-High school and spent a year in the library devouring books on the occult. I want metal to bring me back to the musty ambience of the library I spent so many lunch-breaks. Which means I don't care how many pentagrams and crude logos  you draw on your record; unless you bring the bog-drenched, harrowing mysticism of Wyrd Visions' stripped guitar, double-tracked Swedish vocals, and breathless, frozen air: you have nothing. So, for all you aspiring metal-heads out there: take your cues from this minimal folk departure that will surely solidify Satan's reign and bring victory to the Whore of Babylon. It also helps that he does a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burzum">Burzum</a> cover and has <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jennifercastlemusic">Castlemusic</a> sing with him.
