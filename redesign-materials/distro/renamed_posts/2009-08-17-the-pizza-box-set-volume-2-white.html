In this installment of <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/the-pizza-box-set/"><u>The Pizza Box-Set</a></u> (the second volume, if you will) we will investigate the back-yard freak-out ramblings of White! featuring Lucas, Owen Gaudin (ex-Wicked Awesomes! bass player), Jesse Wilkinson, Russel (Wicked Awesomes! drummer), and Logan Gilmour. White! provides a cheaper-than-25-cents peep into the deranged habits of these ruffians in their most wasted state. It's shear, unadulterated teenage expression at its finest; improvised, absurd, non-linear, poorly recorded and difficult to listen to; sounds that would have found a welcoming home on <a href="http://www.espdisk.com/"><u>ESP-Disk</a></u> in the 60s. Nevertheless, it's an exciting experience that should remind us of what it was like to be young and attempt to capture everything at all costs. Thoughts running through my mind whilst listening: Was I there? Did that just happen? Ham sandwiches in the sky? Are you serious? How can I hang out with these dudes? Can I be down?
