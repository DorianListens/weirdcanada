The philosophical implications of the word "everything" are overwhelming, so I say this with all due caution: the AIDS Wolf live performance is a cantankerous barrage of <i>everything</i>. Yannick's hyper-frenetic drum impalement, Chloe's vexatious bellowing and undulations, and the impossibly patient guitarists whose ability to maintain any sense of artistic composure during their non-pejorative circus is incredible, form the sum of "all things" and shove it down your face in under 3 minutes. It's absolutely overwhelming and beautiful; a palette-cleansing barf mitzvah of the highest disorder. This crowning achievement comes from being one of the hardest working groups in Canada with a strict discipline and philosophy, allowing them to form a <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_(Middle-earth)#Durin.27s_Bridge" target="_blank">Druin's-esque bridge</a></u> between experimental academia and the weird punk crowd. Thus, <i>Pas Rapport</i>, a live recording from their native environment committed to tape and released in a limited edition of 50 to support their tour, cannot adequately contain their audible torrent. But allow your mind to fill-in the fidelity-gaps and you'll whisk yourself away to the static confusion and bludgeoned existence of their live show. Punish yourself and live creatively. I love this band. <b>PS</b> - Chloe and Yannick from AIDS Wolf make incredible art and screenprints, so check out the <u><a href="http://seripop.com/" target="_blank">Seripop</a></u> website. Don't believe me? Here is <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/AIDS_Coogi-contest.jpg" target="_blank">a photo of me</a></u> underneath one of their screens (g/b/w).
