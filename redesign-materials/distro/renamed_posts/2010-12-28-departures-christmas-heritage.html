<b>From the spirited christmas of <a href="http://www.weirdcanada.com" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
<u><a href="http://www.bobbryden.com/" target="_blank">Bob Bryden</a></u>'s recorded legacy is a humbling testament to the zenith of teenage creative potential. At the age of eighteen, Bob walked into a studio to record his fourth LP, the second under the banner of his hand-picked band Christmas (having already recorded two LPs as a leading member of <u><a href="http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/R/Reign_Ghost.html" target="_blank">Reign Ghost</a></u>). <i>Heritage</i> remains a brilliant synthesis of lysergic hard-rock and the emerging streams of progressive shreddery. Crisp, punchy drums burst through the continuous leads, crunchy guitar, and trademark machine-gun bass lines to reveal an imaginative, surprising, and radiant vision of pop musics' future. One of the best and most creative records released in Canada and a great way to start adventuring within Byrden's amazing career.
