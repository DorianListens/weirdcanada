There is something wyrd happening in Lethbridge (aside from the head-shop my cousin operates) and it's seeping out from the strange current of cavernous psychedelic punk that is Endangered Ape; powered, mainly, by a bearded fellow named Paul who's involved (physically or psychically) with a gambit of equally deranged pop-metaphors (Moby Dicks, Myelin Sheaths, Mammoth Cave), all operating in this dubious pocket of civilization skirting the southern border of Canada. Endangered Ape's second album, <i>ape shall not kill ape</i>, channels a wall-of-spectral-noise into their pre-apocalypse evolutionary-doom-punk to create a hybrid assault of roaring-twang and brain-krud. A singular occurrence in Canada's what-the-hell-do-I-call-this spectrum. There are rumors that Endangered Ape are breaking up. I hope not. Perhaps a nation of enthusiasm will keep them together? Go get 'em tiger!
