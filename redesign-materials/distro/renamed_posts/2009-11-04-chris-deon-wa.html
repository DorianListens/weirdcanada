Chris d'eon's debut cassette is an incredible 60-minute multi-genre psychedelic-meets-minimal-techno Tour de Force that will absolutely astonish, bewilder, and bewitch anyone curious enough to catch its spell. Weaving within currents of basemental panned-vocals, reverberated folk and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CKenI4srLE" target="_blank"><u>Chicago-house</a></u>-meets-Boards-of-Canada minimalia, <i>wa al-'asr</i> threatens all norms in genre synthesis and track sequencing. Chris d'eon has shown an incredible knack for branding every species of sound with his personal phantasms; every wavelength tinged with the unabashedly cosmic dark-age strata.  As such, there is a brilliant vision ensconced inside <i>wa al-'asr</i>'s easter-folk and electro meanderings that is unquestionably rebellious; why try to push boundaries when committing every stream of consciousness to tape does the job for you. Let the world figure it out and they'll fail miserably. Thankfully there are sadists like myself who enjoy trying. Amazing. Brilliant. Wonderful. <u><a href="http://numbers-station-recordings.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><i>Buy It <b>Now</b></i></a></u>.
