<b>From the laboratory disaster of <a href="http://texturemagazine.ca/" target="_blank"><u>Jesse Locke</a></u></b>:
Not since the glory days of <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IlHgbOWj4o" target="_blank">Thomas Dolby</a></u> has the world been gifted with such catchy songs about science. Following their debut 7” released via the HoZac Records Hookup Klub, Leth/Death/Methbridge’s Myelin Sheaths are back with another Bunsen-burnt four-song platter, this time stamped with the imprint of Bachelor Records from Austria. AUSTRIA! Big ups, guys. A-side opener “Stackticon” is a scrappy, foaming-at-the-mouth cheerleader chant rocker, clocking in at 1:40 and blown the eff out just like <a href="http://twitter.com/quartermass" target="_blank"><u>Paul Lawton</u></a> loves it. “SPF70” is a moody instrumental with tasteful guitar wrangling that almost sounds surf-y in places, which, now that I think about it, the suntan lotion song title is assuredly alluding to. On the flip, the head-bashing repetition of “Laboratory Disaster” and garagey girl groupisms of “Fun With Science” will be familiar to anyone who’s caught these cats live or copped their O.G. self-released CD. For all your fuzzy, skuzzy weirdo rock needs, the <u><a href="http://mammothcave.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">Mammoth Cave</a></u> keeps on churning out the goods.
