<b>From the portal-books of <u><a href="http://www.texturemagazine.ca/" target="_blank">Jesse Locke</a></u></b>:<br>
For those keeping track at home, Aidan Baker's discography is starting to stretch longer than both his beard and onstage guitar jams. On this split LP, the multi-instrumentalist and founding member of "Ambient Doom" duo <U><a href="http://www.myspace.com/nadjaluv" target="_blank">Nadja</u></a> is in full-on minimalist mode, filling the entirety of his side with the soft-focus tone workout "Disturbances pt. 1 & 2." Movement wise, it's as unhurried as Eno or Stars of the Lid, and equally iridescent. On the flip, Brooklyn's Sarah Lipstate (a.k.a. Noveller) - a member of Rhys Chatham's Guitar Army, Glenn Branca's 100 Guitar Ensemble and formerly <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/partsandlabor" target="_blank">Parts and Labor</u></a> - contributes two shorter songs. In comparison to Baker's piece, her haunting "White Rabbit" and ornate "Under The Color Cave" sound positively lively. This one could be a desert island pick, if that island happened to be <i><u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst" target="_blank">Myst</a></u></i>.
[<b>Levin's Note</b>: Having played <i>Myst</i> (blind subway!), <i>Myst II: Riven</i> (hang-man language thingy!), and <i>Myst III</i>: Exile (bee-hive!), I concur with everything Mr. Locke has stated, and more!]
