There is nothing you can do to prepare for the body-vibrato-inducing onslaught of the 32-bit gravitron-pop that comprises GOBBLE GOBBLE. When I was 16 I saw Carrot Top live in Las Vegas with my mom; we sat next to Steven Speilberg's brother and were told not to look at him. The whole time I was listening to The Jackson 5 on cassette and thinking about seeing Ed Tempelton as we drove through Huntington Beach. The sum of all these experiences (summer, confusion, pop, skateboarding, absurdity, humanity, my mom, and Carrot Top) is my only point of comparison to the aural space-scape of GOBBLE GOBBLE's debut. For those of you who are not me, <i>Neon Graveyard</i> is like a combination of Dan Deacon and the new Dirty Projectors; experimental pedal pushing meets 91.7 The Bounce FM pop sensibilities. It's incredibly lasting and rewarding after multiple listens (unlike Carrot Top). The live show is a different entity in itself; brain-altering displays of fluorescence with wine-bottle percussion, fiber optics, and a lot of dancing. GOBBLE GOBBLE for president.
