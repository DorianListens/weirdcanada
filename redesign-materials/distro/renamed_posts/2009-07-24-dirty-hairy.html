Is it OK to call this pop? The sound is not pop. The approach is probably not either. But there are melodies and rhythms and (possibly) vocals hidden within the streams of prepared piano, coloured noise, and delayed guitar. It's another bend in a flow of records straddling the line between ambient soundscapes and subtle pop; a movement started by Arthur Russell. For a cassette with 18 tracks of experimental excursions, the album provides a more than enjoyable listening experience; you will travel with Headaches through ambient pastures as the roaring hills of processed sound permeate your auricular life-space. And some of it's catchy! It's important to note that the j-card states: PS - It's real.
