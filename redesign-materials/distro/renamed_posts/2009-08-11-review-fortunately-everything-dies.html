We do this thing in campus/community radio where, as Music Directors, we gather the greatest artists in our respective communities and have them share the cost of mailing their music to other campus/community stations (you can fit four CDs in a standard mailer for the postage of one!) I received one of these packages from <u><a href="http://web2.uwindsor.ca/cjam/">CJAM 91.5</a></u> (Windsor, Ontario) and the Fortunately, Everything Dies album immediately caught my eye. The press-release deepened the prevailing sense of mystery: the identity of Fortunately, Everything Dies is unknown and the CDs were dropped off in the middle of the night, each one being a hand-crafted modification of a classical album (a possible ode to Newfoundland's first punk-rock band <u><a href="http://abandonstream.net/slyme/">Da Slyme</u></a>?) The music wavers between ambient drones and glitchy experimental electronics, most of it being really good. I'm going to guess from the song-titles that the individual(s) behind Fortunatley, Everything Dies are fairly young, which excites me all the more. Hooray for mystery!
