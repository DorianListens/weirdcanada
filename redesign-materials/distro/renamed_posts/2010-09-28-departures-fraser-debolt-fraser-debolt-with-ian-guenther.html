<b>From the tennis player waltz of <a href="http://www.weirdcanada.com" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
For an unassuming pair of country-folk dreamers, Allan Fraser and Daisy Debolt's debut resonates with a wyld collection of weirdos: hard-core "psych-folk" collectros, county-fair <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF9yHx7la9I" target="_blank">folk-fest burn-outs</a></u>, cowboy junkers, and record store braggarts alike. For years I've marveled over the LP and its audience without resolution. It could be the innocently tuneless harmonies, the dissonant acoustic jangle, or their harrowing explorations into freak-folk. But it's the songwriting that gets me every time; dualic weaves of fringe rurality; a surrealist vision of Canada rooted in the warm waters of Ontario; a haunting, minor-key acoustic delirium irrigated with country ballads and freak-folk shreddery. You'll never understand it. But eventually it'll <i>happen</i>. I've never been wrong with this one. Top 10 dead or alive LP. They do a devastating cover of <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUr8hs3yWdo" target="_blank">"Don't Let Me Down"</a></u> with an alternate take on the American promo 45. Surprisingly not-very-rare in Western Canada.
