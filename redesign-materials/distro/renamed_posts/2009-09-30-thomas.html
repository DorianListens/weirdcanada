Turn out the lights. Light a candle. Slip into something comfortable. Take it off. <b>Grab a drink and come back to the hot tub</b>. Weird Canada is for sharing and I'd like to introduce someone to you. His name is Thomas. His new album, <i>S E L F H E L P</i> is the post-smooth hyperbole you've been waiting for all day. Fetch me a towel. Allow me to wipe the bubbles off my body and talk seriously for a moment. Thank you. Thomas takes off where the late-70s AOR, yacht-rock movement degenerated into slap-bass bull-crappery and his interpretations are bang-on. In the most serious fashion Thomas covers the gambit from <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodeci" target="_blank">Jodeci</a></u>/<u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nksph5Ep_rs" target="_blank">Guy</a></u>-jack-swing, Hall-and-Oats-esque yach-synth, and Sade--is-his-operator smoothness. Thomas has attended the Tim Buckley school of singing, accentuating his verses with grunts and hollers, bringing this pop-explosion into an other-worldly palm-tree paradise. There are elements of every pop cliche executed brilliantly and fashionably. It's tasteful, sexcellent, and most importantly, strange; dripping with creative genius, every channel of pop has been approached from bizarre, acute angles producing unimaginably beautiful results. It's the soundtrack to an alternate, psychedelic beach party where every dead celebrity is getting down; martinis in their ageless hands tipping their glasses to the young boy riding on the smooth-rock shoulders of pop giants. Need more? Check out the video to Thomas' hit <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3pDUK9plOE" target="_blank">Don't Think, Just Hate</a></u>.
