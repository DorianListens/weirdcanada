Hey Everyone,

I'll be in New York for the next few days attending the infamous <a href="http://wfmu.org/recfair/" target="_blank">WFMU Record Fair</a>. I tried to get some posts done in advance but was not able to. My apologies! If any of you readers are in New York, please stop by! Posts will resume next Wednesday. To give you a hint of what's coming up:

Mess Folk 7"
Tropics lathe
Dirty Beaches split 7"
Data Cave / AHNA split cassette
Slim Twig cassette
Rich Aucoin CDR
Bummer High cassette
... and more!

See you all soon!

Hearts,

Aaron Levin
