<div class="contentReview">
Today's harem of mind-expanding disciples has once again enslaved the flaxen western pastures with expansive aural trudge. Toon Town is home to psych giants <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2011/04/new-canadiana-shooting-guns-harmonic-steppenwolf-bw-dopestrings/" target="_blank">Shooting Guns</a>, and with <em>Born To Deal in Magic: 1952-1976</em>, they preach their apocalyptic revival to the unwashed masses — <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2011/12/new-canadiana-shooting-guns-born-to-deal-in-magic-1952-1976/wc-moosehead/" rel="attachment wp-att-9361" target="_blank">leaving a few carcasses</a> along the way. We're past the antiquation of combines, crop dusters and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWM-fNJ1dO8" target="_blank">funny towns</a>; enter the time of the hyper-evolved mountain man making even more mountainous sounds. With song titles like <a href="http://vimeo.com/31414168" target="_blank">“Public Taser”</a>, “Last Great Depression” and “Stay Awake Forever”, you can truly feel the devilish lament in the hearts and bones of this five-piece. With more releases in the near horizon, that sweet, groovy haze will just get that much sweeter. Good thing these guys bring their lunch pails to work.
