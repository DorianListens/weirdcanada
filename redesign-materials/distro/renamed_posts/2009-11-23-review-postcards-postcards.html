Lie: Edmonton doesn't have summers. It feels like it, though. And as we enter into another forever-long snowy paralysis, the leather pants and busty corsets begin to hide behind North Face and Sun Ice and I'm forced to question: what do goths do without summer? Segue into Postcards debut cassette on Montreal's everything-they-do-is-beautiful <u><a href="http://fixturerecords.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Fixture Records</a></u>. Postcards have little to do with goths or their creative-leathers (that I know about), but they have secretly found the intersection between The Cure and Beat Happening and it's the <i>real</i> soundtrack to <i><u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44MsR4ivxeY" target="_blank">The Lost Boys</a></u></i>; dreamy summery backings that push weary, emotional murmurings into popular heights, breaking all shadows cast by beach pants and trench coats. It's the weirdest depresso party album gleaning creative vices at undiscovered <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpmr8Shy_UA" target="_blank">crossroads</a></u>. It's also got plenty of angular pop lurking around all 12 corners (reminiscent of other releases on the label). What more can you ask for? Fixture Records have delivered yet another trophy in the pop foray. Go and buy the cassette while I make another leather beach-ball.
