Hailing from one of the most northernly outposts in Canada, The Stonefield remain an enigma within the Canadian garage-punk cosmos. An easy personal favorite and serious head-scratcher with its brutal fuzz massacre, dual piano weirdness, and bewildering A/B-side pairing. "Deep <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dQY6dq_v1M" target="_blank">Shades of Blue</a>" oozes an addictive, lysergic weariness with its mid-tempo somber organ stuck firmly in a minor-key while their drummer, seemingly in his own universe, augments the pacing with a complete disregard for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEp7LIzmtVU&feature=related" target="_blank">drum pattern awareness</a>. "Morning Hours", the track that has grippers sweating this single pretty hard, is equally confusing, with a relentless bawdy piano swirling beneath the primitive fuzz lead, secondary organ (two keyboards?!), and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MULexjqrYww&feature=related" target="_blank">bleary vocals</a> (singer Joe Verheyden has stated that he had a flu the day they recorded). The pièce de résistance hits mid-way through "Morning Hours" when one of the most intense and ridiculous fuzz-guitar solos totally drowns out the entire track. I once drove to <a href="http://www.discoverthepeacecountry.com/htmlpages/rycroft.html" target="_blank">The Hub of the Peace</a> (Rycroft) on a mission to uncover the mystery behind the band and their insanely obscure 7" to little success. They recorded in Edmonton and later reformed as The Exit, leaving the rest of the world to ponder the sheer awesomeness and absurdity of their legacy. I'd like to dedicate this post to my very close friend <b>Jon Murphy</b> who has brought a much needed light to many unknown 60s singles throughout Canada, including The Stonefield.
