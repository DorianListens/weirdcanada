Now-legendary Edmonton duo whose fame exploded when the vocalist left for sunny BC. The misconception is that they've broken up; much like the anxious teenage-flirtations that pepper their lyrics, The Bummers are on-again whenever geography permits. There is a clear Beat Happening comparison, but it's really redundant to state. Their songs are so lost-in-time that only the isolated and northernly regions of Edmonton, Alberta could yield such a dated-but-refreshing result. Songs like <i>Zero Girlfriends</i> and <i>Physics for Poets</i> are the finest examples of minimalism outside of Philip Glass and Lamonte Young. There isn't enough room on the internet to gush about their songs.
