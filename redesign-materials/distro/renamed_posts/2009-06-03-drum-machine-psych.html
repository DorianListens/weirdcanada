Viewing the Feral Children spectacle is a truly singular experience; emotional bellowing from the bottoms of a psychedelic vortex. Creating detailed lysergic textures on the fly with the usage of a looping pedal and sampler whilst strumming his uniquely tuned, de-strung guitar. This album got heavy play while I was finishing my thesis, putting out a record, and working full-time. I managed to avoid dropping acid but the album was a certified trip each time I took a break from hell to listen. Highly recommended. A top release from 2008.
