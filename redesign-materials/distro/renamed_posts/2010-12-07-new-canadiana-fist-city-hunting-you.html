<b>From the meth municipality of <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
The gnarly, driving pop sinusoids of Lethbridge's Fist City have finally entombed themselves in one eternal polyvinyl groove. Their catch drips in the ecstatic distortion flowing through the <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/mammothcaverecordings" target="_blank"> Southern Albertan hotbed</a></u>, but it's <i>Hunting You</i>'s torrid leads and dualic vocals that make them a beacon for all things adjective-punk. Well tuned heads will be plugged into their ardent pop sensibilities and otherworldly weirdness, levitating their grey matter to the next level of pop consciousness; a B-Side burner you'll be playing in the shower, popping on a two-wheeler, and jamming down main street throwing fists and launching space rockets. Quintessential grippage from the small library of beautiful no-field Canadiana.
