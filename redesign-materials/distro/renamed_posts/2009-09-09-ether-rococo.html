The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether"><u>ether</a></u> was my favorite physics concept growing up as a kid. Yes, I had a favorite physics concept because I was the 12 year-old loser reading math books instead of Archie. The point is: a pervasive nether-fluid permeating the universe in a futile effort to slow down light is the perfect banner for an experimental punk band from Halifax whose low-end-lo-fi recordings have a penchant for turning up your what-the-fuck-juice viscosity, damping the reverberations of your mind, and raising the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics"><u>Hamiltonian</a></u> of your trash-hollering mechanicals. I'm not kidding around with this physics crap, either; The Ether is on to something and it's going to be everywhere (pun intended). Listen while you still can. Brought to you by the kind folks from <a href="http://campaignforinfinity.blogspot.com/"><u>Campaign For Infinity</u></a>.
