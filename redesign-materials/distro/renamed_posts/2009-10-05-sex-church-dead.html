Canada's modern-psychedelic scene is re-emerging, painted new colours and worshiping new Gods. Gone are the pretenses of 60s pop-lysergia; in its place we gladly fall before false idols and re-hashed idioms. And why not? When it's done well, we put our minds on a true <u><a href="http://therisingstorm.net/the-ca-quintet-trip-thru-hell/" target="">trip thru hell</a></u>. Sex Church easily accomplishes this with their mix of doomy, pedantic guitar drones and gothic romanticism; parsing liturgy and psych in a bewildering and addictive way. The songs are long, depressing and mesmerizing; perfect musical beds for basement-evenings in your teenage vortex. And if that all made sense, they throw in a pop-punk ballad for the last minute of <i>Dead End</i>; nothing is ever too easy anymore. 300 copies pressed on black vinyl via Vancouver's <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/sweetrotrecords/" target="_blank">Sweet Rot</a></u> records. Die vicariously.
