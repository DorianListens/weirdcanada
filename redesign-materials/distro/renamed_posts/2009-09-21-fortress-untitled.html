There is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens" target="_blank"><u>gravity lens</a></u> in Vancouver, bending all things no-wave in a peculiar, time-lapsed direction; each interpreting this re-emerging scene in their own unique way. Fortress is no exception; vocalists Spencer and Kelly take turns dictating and professing as barrages of angular guitar patterns hold their onslaught together.  The effect is hypnotic and you'll hastily submit to their disjointed alter. It's the kind of art-punk that real satanists jam while slaughtering goats. Or, if you're like me, it's the kind of art-punk you jam while playing Magic the Gathering. Either way, Fortress is definitely at the focal point of Vancouver's no-wave <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_well" target="_blank"><u>gravity-well</a></u> and will soon join the ranks of Vancouver art-punk giants from the past (UJ3RK5, Tunnel Canary, Emily, Warsaw, Popular Front, etc.) and present (Shearing Pinx, Sex Negatives, Stamina Mantis, etc.), making claim to every adjective.
