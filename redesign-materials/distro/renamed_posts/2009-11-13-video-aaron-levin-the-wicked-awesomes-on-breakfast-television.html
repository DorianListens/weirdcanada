In preparation for <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/wyrd/" target="_blank"><u>Wyrd Fest</a></u> I was lucky enough to snag a 90 second interview on Breakfast Television (City TV, Cable 7) about the festival followed by a performance by one of my favorite bands in Alberta, <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/wickedawesomes" target="_blank">The Wicked Awesomes!</a></u>.

It was a weird experience being on television. I was kind of disappointed they didn't put makeup on me. I hope I looked sexy in HD.

Hearts,
