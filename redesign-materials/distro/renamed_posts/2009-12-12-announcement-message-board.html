Hey Everyone,

I have been on the internet since the mid-90s. As such, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" target="_blank"><u>BBS</a></u>' of olde thymes played an important role in my search for social networking before those two words were ever placed adjacent to each other. They're a very easy way to stay in touch with groups of people you have some vague common connection to. Unlike Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, et al, message boards are incredibly simple and can be engaging and enriching.

Whatever. The point is that <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/bbs/"><u>I made a message board for Weird Canada</a></u> (or, rather, my friend Ed did - he designed the waxidermy message board for which this was modeled after). I hope it fosters some sense of community with all the players of Canada's fringe music scene. We all just want to have fun so why don't we have fun together?

Features of the message board:

- Announcements / New Releases forum to tell everyone about your new releases and keep me updated with what's going on (for potential exposure on the main-page).
- Two support forums for artists needing assistance with touring and setting up shows.
- A main forum for general discussion and music (read: place for clowning).
- A sales forum where you can hock your goods.

Sign up and give it a chance. There are already a few celebrities posting. See if you can spot them. My username is canonical.

<a href="http://weirdcanada.com/bbs/"><u>http://weirdcanada.com/bbs/</a></u>

PS - And remember, a message board is only as good as the users posting. So, get posting!

Hearts,
