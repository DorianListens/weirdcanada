Saskatoon is Canada's secret cultural hot-spot. The last time I was in Saskatoon I yelled at Herbie Hancock from afar, found one of the rarest Canadian psych records for $3 (<u><a href="http://www.canuckistanmusic.com/index.php?maid=125" target="_blank">Christmas</a></u> on Paragon), made-out with a Lesbian, and stumbled upon picture sleeves from one of Canada's best garage 7"s (The Witness Inc. - <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huH-vObKY6w" target="_blank">Not You Girl</u></a>). My fondness with Saskatoon continued when I met <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/07/safe-language/" target="_blank">Feral Children</a></u> and seems to grow with each Weird Canada submission from the city. Thus, it comes with no surprise that I stumble upon another creative genius conjuring soundscapes in their Saskatoon basement. Poler Bear's ambient canvasses are captivating in every way they shouldn't be; fluxes of multi-instrumental blankets forming pop structures and catchy wisps too slow and wavering for radio pop but too structured to bear the avant-garde moniker. Most of the songs are built around narratives from Canada's landscape: water, people, television, and birds; all playing a role in shaping Poler Bear's soundtrack. It's mellow and soothing and time seems to slip away every time I listen. Hopefully my next trip to Saskatoon will feature more artifacts of Canada's underground, including Poler Bear.
