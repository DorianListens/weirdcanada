<b>From the North of America fanboydom of <a href="http://texturemagazine.ca/" target="_blank"><u>Jesse Locke</a></u></b>:
Other than the guy from Japan who flew to Montreal for their final farewell show a few months back, <u><a href="http://myspace.com/revolutionwinter" target="_blank">Bart Records</a></u> founder Kevin Stebner is quite likely the biggest North of America fan on the planet. Standing next to Stebs at said gig, I was regaled with anecdotes and factoids regarding the members’ current day-jobs, how he caught them live in Europe and just how stupidly excited he is to have now released a rarities compilation from his all-time favourite band. Along with other comp tracks and the previously unearthed jam “Hot Work,” side A is culled from the same sessions that produced NoA’s swan-song LP Brothers, Sisters (a serious tour de force if you’ve never had the pleasure). From the pulverizing guitar-work and clockwork-calculated percussion of barn burners “Beyonce", “Hate The Player” and “We Had To Call Your Parents” to the slower tempo heart-on-sleever “I Like Everything This Much” and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danmcp/sets/72157594294355299/" target="_blank"><u>curious electronic</a></u> interlude “Let’s Get Glitch,” <i>12345678910</i> is veritable <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_Mana" target="_blank">Mana</a></u> for Maritime math-rock devotees. Somebody update the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_of_America" target="_blank"><u>wikipedia</a></u>…
