Without a doubt AHNA's <i>Red Tape</i> was in my top 5 independent releases of of 2008. Anju and Graeme, the two components which make AHNA, attack minimalism armed with a violin and bass guitar. The violin provides hidden structure within the undulating currents of bass-drone while they march forward into a triumphant summit; quick-victors atop a vertex of creative streams. Or, perhaps, a vortex? Either way, the two-track, 20-minute cassette is a rewarding, engaging, and wonderful listening experience. <i>Red Tape</i> is a rare treat in the experimental cosmos worth returning to; something we will surely look back on as wisps of distortion wash away our memories. I just wish it was longer!
