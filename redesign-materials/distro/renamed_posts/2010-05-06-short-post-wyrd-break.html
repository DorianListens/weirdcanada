Hey Everyone,

In case you've been endlessly hitting the refresh button in the hopes of an update, I thought I would chime in to say I'll be taking a break and will resume posting on Monday! Jesse Locke has already submitted a nice review of the DUZ/CUZ split cassette, so I'm excited to get back at it.

A full "review" of <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/wyrd" target="_blank">Wyrd Alberta</a></u> will be written over the weekend. In the meantime, I'd like to thank all the bands, volunteers, and attendees that supported the festival. It was a definite success in each city. Lastly, but not least, I'd like to thank Paul Lawton from Mammoth Cave, Zak Pashak and Drew Marshall from Sled Island, and Marie LeBlanc Flanagan for their help with the festival.

More posts soon!
