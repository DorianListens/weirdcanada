The past three years have seen Shearing Pinx focus their creative blasts from harsh noise-punk to decimating experimentalism, tying together streams of sans-wave, noise, 90s-whatever-rock, and experimental every/any/something. <i>Weaponry</i>, Shearing Pinx's first of two slated albums on Halifax's <u><a href="http://www.divorcerecords.ca/" target="_blank">Divorce Records</a></u>, is by far their most meditative release and leaps into the unchartered netherlands of <b>post-ritual druid-wave</b>; ruminating vocals pierce through our cosmetic musical barriers and channel sinusoidal rhythms embedded within searing pleas of release (I'm really trying to convey a feeling I've had while listening to this record for the past four days straight and it's hard). <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform" target="_blank">Fourier</a></u> would be proud as the album converges; inspiring, leading, and transcending national boundaries in an effort to present the world with one the best adjective-punk records of 2009. My highest recommendation.
