There are pockets of exciting, creative energies hidden all over Canada. I can't find them all, so credit for this discovery goes to Jenni from <a href="http://www.myspace.com/illfatoutpie"><u>Illfit Outfit</u></a>. She e-mailed me to the effect of "I like your blog. There is this guy that makes great music in his basement." Fairly typical story I thought, until I landed on his myspace page and was immediately wooed by the triumvirate of bursting lo-fi pop, sensitive-and-sweet basement loner folk, and scattered noisescapes. A few convincing MySpace messages later and I get a CD in the mail that (very quickly) peels my wig back (to use the parlance of mid-90s rap gangstery). Aaron Read, performing under Arron, has a sweet, boyish, and endearing voice suited well for his combination of frenetic pop lonertude and campfire folk. Lyrically, he crafts narratives and hooks with a psychedelic edge, keeping us immersed in his own personal snow-globe. It's the kind of CD I expect to come from Calgary, an artifact left in the wake of bands like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/womenmusic"><u>Women</a></u> and <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/08/hunting-and-gathering/"><u>Hunter-Gatherer</a></u>; thankfully, these streams of ingenious melodies seem to pop up everywhere.
