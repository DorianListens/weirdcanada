After seeing Mount Analogue live in Edmonton I accidentally got one of their songs stuck in my head. For five days. I would saunter into work chanting <i>victims, victims, victims...!!</i> People were staring at me, my boss was angry, the volunteers I work with seemed distant and reluctant to file CDs in the CJSR library. Meanwhile, I'm chanting, chanting, chanting and suddenly I started growing a beard and writing down schemes for a religious cult. I wanted other people to chant with me. A chapel full of them. With a backing band (preferably Mount Analogue if they're available). Victims, victims, victims! Well, thankfully, after a while the Contortions-fused, four-on-the-floor disco-or-is-it-art-punk drama of Mount Analogue reached it's religious zenith and ascended down to <s>normality</s> radality. That is, until they toured through Edmonton with a new cassette. And, well, the cycle begins anew. Victims, victims, victims...
