<b>From the random career raps of <a href="http://infinestyle.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><u>Christopher Bateman</a></u></b>:
Considering our distance from Hip Hop's 80's <u><a href="http://map.rapgenius.com/" target="_blank"> epicentre</a></u>, you can hardly blame Edmonton for taking so long to start rapping. More than a decade after the Sugarhill Gang kicked down the door wavin' the Kaopectate, Edmonton's MC A-Okay amassed a crew of <u><a href="http://www.wem.ca/" target="_blank">West-enders</a></u> to lay-down what would become some of Edmonton's earliest rap recordings. A-Okay's <i>DOPE M.O.B</i> demo is super-impressive, sounding like a <u><a href="http://www.soundsoftheuniverse.com/releases/?id=14240" target="_blank">random</a></u> from any American city (read: <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Sweat_the_Technique" target="_blank"> Eric B and Rakim</a></u>) and includes classic posse cuts from the DOPE (Disciples Of Poetic Expression) Mob, hard raps about being a drug dealer ("Guess Who's Coming to Your Town"), and your basic pop-rap fan-fare ("Move the Groove" was eventually picked up for the successful-in-Canada <i>We United to Do Dis</i> album by <u><a href="http://www.discogs.com/Simply-Majestic-The-Album-We-United-To-Do-Dis/release/164885/" target="_blank"> Simply Majestic</a></u>). With as few as 20 copies made (my copy was even found missing the actual cassette!) <i>DOPE M.O.B</i> stands as a rare and wonderful view into the beginnings of a prairie-town's rep. Essential <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/?attachment_id=5094" target="_blank"><u>back-cover scan</a></u>. Yes, that's a recycled Parental Advisory sticker.
