<b>From the breaking point of <a href="http://www.weirdcanada.com" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
Obscure lyrsergic artifact from the totally unpsychedelic pastures of 60s Edmonton, Alberta. Jack Hennig's second foray into the world of self-released 7" obscurity left us with two syrupy, drug-induced pop-psych laments. <i>Maybe Tomorrow</i>'s classic garage-punk woes pull the untamed ears to oblivion while the faux-sitar and pop harmonies on <i>Busy People</i> win me over with vintage diy conviction. Jack Hennig would go on to be a <u><a href="http://waxidermy.com/jack-hennig-and-the-breaking-point-group-busy-people-bw-maybe-tomorrow-cupid-records/" target="_blank">country singer of national renown</a></u> and now resides in Edmonton having forgotten almost everything about his hip-trip maneuvers with The Breaking Point Group.
