Someone bought a ticket to London, 1985. The Montreal duo walked into Human League's studio and downloaded Philip Oakley's soul into Garage Band. Infectious synth-pop of the highest retro variety. While many throw-back groups suffer from sounding stale and "modern," I get a complete vintage vibe from this band that goes beyond audio and into the writing, phrasing, and sexualizing. I have on idea what they sound like live, but the 12-song CDR released in late-2008 is a pop sensation. Sean Nicholas Savage sings on a few songs.
