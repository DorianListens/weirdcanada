<b>From the pocketed mesh-back of <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
It's our future babylon: yuppies and junkies coagulating to celebrate their mutant post-human hedonism. And in some grande irony, the lounge-garage stylings of Makeout Videotape will <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8basACl30o" target="_blank">part every velvet curtain</a></u> to entertain the new world's last taste of love; vocalist Mac DeMarco's million-dollar smile and soaring croons calming their insatiable desires. <i>Eating Like a Kid</i> is a mesmerizing departure from Makeout Videotape's onslaught of <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/06/red-line-pizza-dog/" target="_blank"><u>red-line garage-punk</a></u>; the hooks are intelligently buried while its melodies leave traces and flashbacks to Mac's ageless smile. If there is love in the future it's the sudden realization that <i>they</i> are speaking to <i>us</i> and as we turn around from our slot-machines, cocaine, sex, pizza, and peep shows - as we turn from our epicurean lives - we will see Mac smiling and know: death is all right so long as someone is singing. <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jSls6FnQ6k" target="_blank">Mac's golden voice</a></u> is floating atop rivers of reverberating guitars, sailing Makeout Videotape into this new future America and we're all on board.
