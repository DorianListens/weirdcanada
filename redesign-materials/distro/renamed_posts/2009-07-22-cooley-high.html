Weightless jet-streams of chords soak every minute of this odd split cassette from Saskatoon that clocks in at an astonishing 90 minutes. Caves projects his shoegazing kite along these contorted winds to produce pop-scapes that stretch our emotional imagination. On the flip, Stephen Cooley scales it back to traditional ambient themes that seem to weave between the reverberated vocal echoes and field recordings. Both Caves and Stephen Cooley are quite active in the Saskatoon scene, playing in a number of weird projects (Lion Stab, The Foggy Motions, A Gentle Forest, etc.) I look forward to more from these SK basement weirdos.
