<b>From the partially-ordered, semi-continuous grippage of <a href="http://www.weirdcanada.com" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
We have witnessed the possessed meanderings of teenagers pushed to the creative fringe for years. It's not uncommon these days for some residential weirdo to emerge from their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1hEKqZz-OY" target="_blank"><u>suburban cave</a></u> with a MySpace full of damaged sounds teetering on the edge of unsanity. This was not the case for Canada's underground rock scene of the 60s, whose output pales numerically to our American counterparts, owing to a lack of custom pressing plants and home-recording equipment. Which is why it's incredible that Calgarian <a href="http://www.candisc.com/02news/02_0510.html" target="_blank"><u>Doug Wong</a></u>, at the tail end of 1969, when psychedelic music delivered its last blow to the world's unsuspecting youth, decided to package the last issue of his high-school newspaper with a 7" of school "rock bands" (I've posted the full story <a href="http://waxidermy.com/va-dove-project-no-9-no-label-1970/" target="_blank"><u>here</a></u>). The resulting 7" has become a truly bewildering artifact of Canada's marginalized fringe music community: a compilation of unfettered teenage expression; trashy, face-melting, fuzz-drenched glorious hard-rock mingling amongst Dylan-inspired folk and sunshine pop. A beautiful peak into the small lives of folk-club weirdos at a time when their sounds usually withered and vanished. Amazing and incredibly rare. This is the <a href="http://www.texturemagazine.ca/aaronLevin.html" target="_blank"><u>third time</a></u> I've written about this record and it still astounds me.
