<b>From the perilous necklace of <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
I want to live <i>Precious Necklace</i>. I want tight sweaters. VIP access to the clurb. Double martinis. False love. Teen soundtracks blasting. I want the whole world in a song and I want to dance; pulsing drum machines, echoey vocals and exaggerated pop-harmonies. Let the music take you back in time. Nintendo, cocaine, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpbOkyuyADU" target="_blank"><u>plastic people</a></u>, and radio hits. Sex in bathrooms and parental neglect. Stereotypes. We've lost our youth. We can take it back. The Silly Kissers, in a futuristic act of <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eleoJabi2os" target="_blank">heroism</a></u>, are our only hope. Their fourth and most realized effort to-date showcases their perfected 80s-pop ventriloquism. <i>Precious Necklace</i> is a re-imagining that only nostalgia can deliver; glossing over the weaknesses of an era we will never <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzGrxUFvyw" target="_blank">truly understand</a></u> and manipulating the pearls of its bounty to deliver every genre's saving grace: synthetic pop perfection. <i>Precious Necklace</i>, released as a limited-edition 10" on Montreal's <u><a href="http://www.arbutusrecords.com/" target="_blank">Arbutus Records</a></u>, is a 10/10 major-scale heart-melt. The world has never needed so much. They will deliver. GRIP. IT. NOW.
