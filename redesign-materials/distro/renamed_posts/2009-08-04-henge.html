Take two talented women in the experimental foray. Give them a side of C30. If you're lucky you'll end up with something close to <i>Henge</i>; two sides of atypically-driven drone. Anju Singh (of <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/index.php?s=ahna"><u>AHNA</u></a>) delivers a quarter-hour piece of violin static that patiently builds into multi-feedback noise-scapes; effectively rendering the previous 14 minutes of your existence into a zone of bewilderment. On the flip we have Knell, an interesting side project of <a href="http://www.mintrecs.com"><u>Mint Records</u></a> recording artist <a href="http://www.myspace.com/kellarissa"><u>Kellarissa</u></a>, venturing deep within the rarely charted territory of vocal looping. This is not classical choral material; her voice is quickly fractured into subliminal jet-streams of ambience whose minute being coalesces within various meditative drone-states. Both sides of <i>Henge</i> have the same weird attention-sucking immediacy despite being unassuming and "mellow." Another brilliant addition to the ever-growing Isolated Now Waves catalog.
