What happens when you walk out of a Stooges concert in 1970? Oh, and you live in Ohio. It's important that you live in Ohio because only an American state so singular in its musical weirdness could produce the improvised psychedelic shreddery contained in the <i>Daily Dance</i>. Doug and Bon witnessed the intensity of a Stooges live performance and the free-improvised freak-outs of The Velvet Underground and decided to make a record <i>heavier</i> than both. The result was the <i>Daily Dance</i> and it has enamored freaks like Carla Bley and myself and every other person who has witnessed the sheer audacity of its existence. There is no pretense of philosophy; just an unassuming academic-looking cover and a beautiful, sun-bleached photo of the meditative performance that we eventually hear. There was no sound like this before <i>Daily Dance</i>. There are few like it now.

<i>Daily Dance</i> was reissued by the Edmonton-based label <a href="http://www.cantorrecords.com/">Cantor Records</a>.  The original LP was self-released in 1973 in a tiny run of 500 copies.
