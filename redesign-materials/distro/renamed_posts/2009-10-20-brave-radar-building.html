Daring portrayals of angular pop lurk around every corner of <i>A Building</i>. Montreal's Brave Radar perfected the immensely difficult and hugely rewarding dialectical synthesis of jarring tonality and warm, sunday afternoon coffee-in-triplicate pop. Thus, it's fitting they released a beautifully designed digipak on <u><a href="http://www.fixture-records.com" target="_blank">Fixture Records</a></u>, Canada's finest boutique fringe-pop emporium. Within the swirls of keyless harmonies and wasted guitar-mockery lay hidden phrases of pop's greatest secrets; Brave Radar discovered music's reticent obsessions and they're not afraid to wrap it in audible mysteries, drowning them in seas of lo-fidelity. Dive right in, reveal their secret leviathan, and find yourself addicted to the manic portrait of known sounds.
