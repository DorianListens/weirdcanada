<u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/weirdcanadahq-2009-11-25.jpg" target="_blank">Weird Canada HQ</a></u> is under the Tonstartssbandht spell, so instead of posting the <i>Dick Nights</i> review, I'll post a review of the fictional <i>Dick Nights</i> movie running through my mind. <i>Dick Nights</i> documents the mescaline-induced wanderings of a brotherly Barbershop duo <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0ML3XsmS7w" target="_blank">lost in east L.A.</a></u> They're trying to win earth and save their father who fell ill after drinking left-over TMNT™ ooze during his brief stint as an extra for the <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv3S94tQy2s" target="_blank">Turtles in Time</a></u> remake. Only Christmas caroling in the world's most falsely represented neighborhood will raise the funds necessary for dad's ooze transplant (what?). And so Edwin and Edwin's-brother, armed with looping pedals and the most extravagant pop hollerings this side of any <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fks_6d1prC8" target="_blank">Disney™ soundtrack</a></u>, are ready to expropriate your mind with their choralic minimalism. They've amassed a new world order with their throats; poor souls hypnotized under Tosntartssbandht's cosmic orations, every jangled follower a vocal-cog in their diabolic choir soon capable of singing to the world. Aim your voices high, my friends, because there's only one thing standing between Tonstartssbandht and the money needed for their dad's surgery... THIS SATURDAY... <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Up_and_Say..._Ahh!" target="_blank">OPEN UP AND SING</a></u>... <i>DICK NIGHTSSSSSSSSSS</i>.
