After losing my car in a Chinatown parking lot and receiving an impromptu studio interview on KPFK, I'm feeling a bit Judgement Night. Thankfully, no rap-rock is anywhere near my eardrums, but, unfortunately, the whirling Canadian underground shall not bestow itself upon this page until tomorrow. 

Yours in LA,
