This side project from <a href="http://www.myspace.com/outdoorminers">Outdoor Miners</a>' frontman Peter S. has to be the best lo-fi pop excursion done with two feet, two hands, one guitar, and two drums. When you write it out like that it seems like a lot is going on, but it's just Peter. And it's incredible to see him work the double kick-on-a-snare drum setup while picking away at some of the catchiest and memorable guitar hooks and singing in his lazy sunday-family-drive-in fashion. The album is dedicated to the same little brown girl who made the custom covers for each CDR. They printed 50 and were pretty much sold-out before the release party.
