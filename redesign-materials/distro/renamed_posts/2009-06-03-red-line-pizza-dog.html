<div class="contentReview">
The first demos by Makeout Videotape had this heavy cassette-warble from the red-line recordings made directly to cassette. Add the immensely catchy lyrics about typical girl bullshit and I was completely won over. I eagerly awaited his official released and was initially disappointed to see all new songs. The waves of distortion washed over me and my opinions were born anew in the wasteland of teenage sexual tension and Nilson covers. It wasn't long before I was, once again, thwarting the recordings on all my friends and hassling the Edmonton ex-pat for more.
