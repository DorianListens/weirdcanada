<b>From the northernly service of <a href="http://www.weirdcanada.com" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
Mystic folk-psych drifting between a Native American tradition and the first wave of acoustic lysergia. Morley's intimate Cree singing is augmented by woven strands of ethereal flute, hand percussion, and melancholic guitar, conjuring a dense empathetic miasma. One of the most affecting records I've ever heard. Found in a pile of CBC Northern Broadcast Recording 7"s I received from a friend and the only of its kind I've ever encountered. If you know anything about Morley Loon (who unfortunately passed away some years ago), please get in touch. A short history of recording sessions in this series can be found <u><a href="http://www2.brandonu.ca/Library/cjns/8.2/lintell.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></u> (PDF). 500 copies pressed and distributed as promos.
