<b>From the mind-splintered-like-a-prism of <a href="http://avantlard.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><u>Zachary Fairbrother</a></u></b>:
Ryan Kirk is a graduate of the Dalhousie University Composition Program. He regularly plays with <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2010/08/new-canadiana-the-ether-folly/" target="_blank">The Ether</a></u> and <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/ommacobba" target="_blank">OmmaCobba</a></u>, and has collaborated with fellow 902 weird folker <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/11/review-gown-the-old-line/" target="_blank">Gown</a></u>. As part of the Divorce Records <u><a href="http://www.divorcerecords.ca/mainpages/freewave.html" target="_blank">FreeWave</a></u> series, Kirk sees his first release drifting from his earlier drone explorations (See <u><a href="http://snappedinhalf.blogspot.com/2009/02/wargaz-st-cdr.html" target="_blank">Wargaz</a></u>) into the further regions of modality, timbre, and tuning. <i>Microtonal Freewaves</i> plays with the ideas of tuning ala minimalist composers like La Monte Young and mainlines it with neo-folk stylings, producing an audible trace akin to the spots on blue cheese. The opening track "Weekends" starts with a beautiful field recording of the Nova Scotian landscape, setting the album's tone with a lone slide guitar. Juxtaposed with these are excerpts of his saxophone quartet and piece for bowed strings, both being beautiful sheets of spectral harmonics. The album clocks in at just below 22 minutes but definitely feels like youâ€™ve traveled a long way when it's finished. Recommend listening straight through. In solitude. Absolutely NO computer speakers!
