I remember being young once. I would prance around my basement in pajamas playing Zelda and fighting with my brother. This one afternoon I watched all the American Ninja movies and tried to do a front-flip off a small play-coffee-table. I landed on my back and knocked the wind out of my body. I recall laying on the floor in shame as the world circled above me in a fizzy haze of creative indulgence. Had I been a better ninja I would have landed on my feet to the roaring audience of my brother. Calgary's Hunter-Gatherer is a better ninja. They skirt the challenging math-pop with a fizzy edge that puts them in a category no American Ninja dare venture; deep in the wooded grounds of dissonant-catchiness and inordinate-yet-amazing-harmonies. I've been listening to their EP repeatedly and I keep returning to that exercise of my physical limitations; as the world once spun in my childhood eyes, so will Hunter-Gatherer's whirlwind of distorted-pop ramble on in your ears. Hopefully you'll land on your feet. That metaphor makes no sense (it's a metaphor?).
