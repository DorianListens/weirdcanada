<b>From the kraazy Saskatoon lovertude of <a href="http://infinestyle.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><u>Christopher Bateman</a></u></b>:
Ever wondered what a Prince or Babyface-inspired boy from the Canadian prairies looks and sounds like? By 1995, <u><a href="http://www.njs4ever.com/index.cfm/pageId/36" target="_blank">New Jack Swing</a></u> was on its way out of radio favor and Saskatoon is about as far from a stronghold of hip hop informed R&B that you can get, but for better or for worse, that never stopped Indianapolis-born T. Lyles from putting out a collection of New Jack swangers in the heart of Joni-town. It is not exactly clear how Lyles is connected to Saskatoon, but it was there that he created his 12-bar New Jack rub-down of an album. For the most part, the disc is more weird than bangin', but it stands as a curious peek into an outsider prairie new jack inductee.
