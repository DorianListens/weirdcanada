From the bubblegum pink loins of London comes this surprising little mix of some of Canada’s funniest, danciest, darkest and weirdest tracks. It begins gruff ‘n’ ruff with the Marlborough mumblings of <a href="http://vimeo.com/876932" target="_blank">Rip Tricker</a>, living up to his name with a poetically curt account of last Christmas morning, waking up drunk in the bathroom with flashes of “last night” fleeting in and out of his damaged recollections.  Sean Savage lubes the deal with his whispered pining and subtle-beyond-any-understanding “<a href="http://soundcloud.com/arbutus-records/sean-nicholas-savage-chin-chin" target="_blank">Chin Chin</a>” to push you deeper into the wash of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/familiarfish" target="_blank">Water St. Projects</a>’ uplifting cry for “HELP!” The order takes a turn for the curse with <a href="http://handstogether.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Eros Myth</a>’s album/val-kill “Chessed Quest”, a gamer’s anthem. Just as you reach for your VHS copy of The Wizard (complete with Power Glove, “it’s so bad”), a burlap bag is thrown over your head and you are dragged though the cybersphere hearing blips of darkness on the rise when you find yourself on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/llihedamnam" target="_blank">Man Made Hill</a>’s “Sports Craft.” D-Sauce and Electric Stan make old seem very, very new with a borrowed bass line and recognizable riff that will make you want to join the Navy and lube your man up with buttah. The list honestly goes on and I could pun myself stupid but some WC favourites find themselves right at home amidst Londoners like Itsagamble, Flora, The Indigenous Nudes, Holden Main, TOPPS, New Zebra Kid, Ian Doig-Phaneuf, I Smell Blood, The Shanty Tramps, Thesis Sahib, Riderless, S.M., You’ll Never Get To Heaven and The Coconuts. This mix was put together to showcase our Forest City’s movement away from Forced Shitty. A new dawn is rising in London with tastes for almost any pallet. Enjoy all 31 tracks individually (even though it was created really as one play list tenderly groomed by Bot Dog of Hot Dog) and give yourself a reason to come here next time you’re looking for a *wink* good time.
