<b>From less-business savvy mind of <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com" target="_blank">Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:<br>
With four national tours (and countless regional), and minds capable of organizing vast piles of minutiae, there is no band more fit to compile such a treatise on the topic of harsh Canadian touring than FAMINES. They've made every mistake and achieved every success; packed basements and pseudo-stadium seating alongside the desolation of playing to the opening band. All the while seeking input from every band, venue, promoter, and person at every level. And they've compiled all of this information in a handy pamphlet of strange proportions. Topics covered include: The First Things, Planning a Soft Route, A Note on Pay What You Can, Who to Send, How Many to Send, When, A Short Economics Lesson on Being a Touring Band, and others. Purchase: <u><a href="http://thefamines.ca" target="_blank">here</a></u>. Seriously essential stuff.
