The Myelin Sheaths were sold out of their CDR after devastating a small crowd during Calgary's <a href="http://www.sledisland.com/"><u>Sled Island</u></a> music festival. And dammit, my ass is burnt! I never got one and now I want one! When they were ready to record, Martine and Cassandra, founders of Myelin Sheaths, approached Paul from <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/08/whites-of-my-eyes/"><u>Endangered Ape</u></a> as the resident Lethbridge recording weirdo.  Paul hastily joined the band and took a producing role. The result is a qualitative analysis in pulverizing sci-punk; imagine William Gibson trying to write a biology textbook with a busted Fender drenched in ink. It's fun, it's rad, it's vaguely educational, and it sounds like absolute crud; fragmented distorto-thoughts oozing out of your nervous system in a ridiculous attempt to escape the cavernous spectral-noise that is Paul's hallmark recording style. Myelin Sheaths will be a big deal whether you like it or not. Look out for an upcoming 7" on <a href="http://www.hozacrecords.com/"><u>Hozac Records</a></u>. Lethbridge shreds. Paul shreds. Myelin Sheaths shred. Let's shred with them.
