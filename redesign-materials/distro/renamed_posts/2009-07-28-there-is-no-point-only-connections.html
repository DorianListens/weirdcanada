Easily over-looked, certainly under-appreciated, Forgetful Florence's peculiar debut took a month to settle before the songs started swirling in my mind like a pop-folk-panic the summer will never escape from. The vocalist and main woman behind this basically-a-solo-project reminds me of Nico if you removed the atonal pretentiousness and moved the East Village into Edmonton's southside. The songs hold their own weight, but it's the strange usage of distorted leads, hand-claps, and other unknown instruments that really takes this album beyond your average basement acoustic-pop endeavor and into the world of uncategorized brilliance that only the underground can offer. Props to Garrett (who now plays bass for The Wicked Awesomes!) for channeling Forgetful Florence's creative genius in the rightfully-wyrd direction.
