<b>From shadowy mind of <a href="http://www.weirdcanada.com" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
I can imagine the face-melt spreading across Canada as <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lu9e27Yur0U" target="_blank">unhip</a></u> DJs first heard The Plastic Cloud's debut single. The sunny-side pop geniality had already taken hold by 1967, but The Plastic Cloud were ready to lift new listeners into unknowable heights. Bludgeoning first timers with aggressive, searing guitar leads, off-kilter crooning, and droning guitar jangle, it's easy to see how "Shadows Of Your Mind" has become the best psychedelic song written in Canada. Their journey embodies all the quintessential lysergic chemistry, twisting the temporal hourglass and tuning every nerd to the new world frequency. While their album sells for hundreds of dollars and is considered a classic of the genre, hip teenagers can still cop originals of this single for under fifty bucks. Released on the legendary <u><a href="http://www.superoldies.com/allied.html" target="_blank">Allied Records</a></u>.
