<div class="contentReview">
After the insanity of NXNE, our Searchlight acceptance / trophy-drinking bender and (wildest of all) Wyrd MTL, team WC has been in dire need of an Internet sabbatical. Seven days later, we’re now rested and ready to resume our daily operations, but would first like to extend a formal “Thank you!” to everyone who made the weekend of June 18-20 one for the record books.

The fine folks at Flemish Eye <http://www.flemisheye.com/> deserve major kudos for putting in all the hard work to throw a killer, sold out showcase at the Great Hall, while the stacked lineup was a banger from start to finish. Most importantly, thanks to the amazing fans that showed up to pack the venue to the rafters! Big ups to Grant Lawrence and the rest of the CBC Radio 3 crew for presenting us with our chalice, and bigger cheers to Sailor Jerry™ for filling it up afterwards.

Finally, for everyone who traveled from near or far to be part of the first annual Wyrd MTL, we’d like to deliver the biggest thanks of all. To all 10 incredible acts who blazed it up, the record labels and Raymond Biesinger holding it down at the Mega Merch Bazaar (next year: lamps!), the tireless sound guys at La Sala Rossa, our unflappable volunteers and door crew, the radio rockers from CKUT for live broadcasting the show, Mike and Pam for their continuing coverage on the <a href="http://thebillmurrayradioshow.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Bill Murray Radio Show</a>, Rob Starrat for constructing our floor stage, <a href="http://www.casadelpopolo.com/suoniperilpopolo/" target="_blank">Suoni per Il Popolo</a> for graciously co-presenting the event, and all the audience members who came out to enjoy the show: merci encore! Can’t wait to do it again next year…
