<b>From the Dwindle Kindle of <a href="http://texturemagazine.ca/" target="_blank"><u>Jesse Locke</a></u></b>:
With their 2010 split tour cassette, Halifax heartthrobs Duzheknew and Cousins carry on the Maritime tradition of sophisticated slacker rock (not an oxymoron). First up is Duz with an unlikely yet successful amalgamation of Spencer Krug warble, Abe Vigoda tropical punk and brainy Talking Heads pop. One to watch out for! Meanwhile, Cousins have dropped down to a duo since the release of their <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/12/review-cousins-out-on-town/" target="_blank">debut</a></u>, turning up the spotlight on drummer-singer Aaron Mangleâ€™s falsetto and knocking all three tunes out of the park. Sadly the first run of 100 is sold out, but look for a re-dub with fresh colour schemes just in time for <u><a href="http://divorcerecords.ca/mainpages/obey.html" target="_blank">Obey</a></u>.
[<b>Levin's Note</b>: I tried to stop doing these "Levin's Notes" things, but I couldn't help it for this one. Been waiting for anything DUZHEKNEW related for way too long. This cassette slays!!]
