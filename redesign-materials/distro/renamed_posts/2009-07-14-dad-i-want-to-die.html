Halifax has this propensity to insert pop into everything it produces. Maybe it's because the musical land-scape is like a giant venn-diagram with every genre-cloud fornicating until the only thing left is post-frat-orgy-remorse. Who cares? At the end of the day you end up with boundary pushing music that is incredibly accessible. York Redoubt's debut cassette, <i>Cheap Funerals</i>, takes the insane time-changes and chord progressions often seen in arithmetic-rock and calculates its anti-derivative (with respect to time) to produce math-pop; it's weird, it's changing, it's catchy. There are red-line vocals, noise freak-outs, songs that sound like pre-Sook-Yin-<i>The</i>-<i>Wedge</i>, panned-guitars, and more! And they've fit it all on a four-song cassette. Bravo!
