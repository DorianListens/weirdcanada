From the monomythic archways of <a href="http://www.thecoast.ca/" target="_blank">Alison Lang</a>:

<div class="contentReview">
Halifax's most endearing/enduring art space, the <a href="http://www.khyber.ca/" target="_blank">Khyber</a>, has once again been feted with a compilation of tape tunes from local artists and musicians, most of whom have played/jammed/come of age under the archways, the ballroom, the turret. As with last year's comp, this is a love letter to something fragile and beautiful and important - moreover, it's massive (27 songs!), thoughtfully curated and brilliant. There are so many meaty, gorgeous gems here - <a href="http://mmyth.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Monomyth</a>'s "Anytime" is soaring sweetgaze, while scene vets Scribbler reach achingly fuzzed-out heights with "No Curtains." The winsome youngsters of ISBN donate a slice of grainy, brainy twang-pop and there are similarly tasty outings from the now-defunct Long Long Long and its ashes, <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2012/04/new-canadiana-each-other-traces-to-nowhere-bw-sit-still/" target="_blank">Each Other</a>, risen in Montreal to smile and destroy. There's a ripper <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2012/03/new-canadiana-dog-day-deformer/" target="_blank">Dog Day</a> track too, and a song from local supergroup Green and Darnelle that nods at the city's 90's ghosts and then gnashes them to shreds. Look, I could go on for fucking pages about this tape, I really could, but in the end, I'll leave with some words from a particular standout, the haunting lament "Wind Came Through" by Former Roommates (who, I think, actually are former roommates): The Khyber needs your love, always, and these songs do too. Listen and linger: this is a sound of a scene piled with riches.
