For the first installment of the <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/the-pizza-box-set/">Pizza Box-Set</a></u> we will go back into the lives of Lucas Wilfred Finnamore-Gochgarian and Thomas Gaudin (synth player and singer of <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/07/turbo-future/">The Wicked Awesomes!</a></u> respectively). The Cadavers provide true, fossilized evidence of The Wicked Awesomes!'s frankenstein-esque mashery of gothic surf-punk and Black Lipsian garage. Joining Thomas and Lucas in The Cadavers are two bros named Chad and Liam (I have no idea who they are - but I'm sure they're wonderful). Thomas shows considerable promise as a singer, and indeed his work with The Wicked Awesomes! proves this. On the other hand, Lucas shows considerable promise as an exceptionally creative person, which he certainly is. They have a song called 9-Day Rat-Stache and as a soon-to-be 28 year-old who cannot grow facial hair, the song resonates very strongly with me. Long live the Pizza Box-Set.
