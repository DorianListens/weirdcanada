It takes an incredible amount of patience to make an album like <i>The Blistering Sun, The Pale Moon, Hahahaha</i>. It's careful and deliberate; calculated without losing any ounce of intimacy; sparse, yet still engaging. Its minimalism is like a barren landscape whose terrain takes great form as you listen closer; diamonds, cacti, and beautiful insects crawling amongst the sandy-chords and phased vocals. There is a great amount of subtly that makes KNOTS so much more than a 'guy with his guitar making a loner folk album in his basement.' KNOTS delivers singer songwriter material that helps us forget how cliche the genre has become.
