Scribbler is, as far as I can tell, a strange group of pseudo-druid, feudal-revivalists operating in the Halifax region (where there are more bands than people). I got their 7" in the mail and it's a mixed brew of depressing one-mic-in-a-box loner folk, manic distorted folk-rock, and (my favorite) a thirty-second cosmic noise-hippie freak-out. Even stranger is their remix project featuring a variety of artists I had never heard about doing even-weirder interpretations of their songs (including one amazing electro-psych track that's no longer on their **Space (but will hopefully be on the soon-to-be-released C-90 containing all the remixes)). You, the reader, are also welcome to participate in the remix project, so feel free to contact them. In the meantime, pick up the 7" if you're into echoey lonertude from the bowels of Canada's most creative city.
