There is a song on Mess Folk's CDR debut that summarizes his interpolated stream-of-consciousness garage-psych misery: <i>Don't Steal My Medication</i>. There were two occasions in my life where I ended up serving coffee in my apartment to women who had <s>escaped</s> taken leave from the mental health ward. The situations were scary, uncomfortable, weird, exciting, messy, and bizarre. Which is why I'm glad someone has been withholding Mess Folk's medication as he continues to besiege the world with his ramshackle of raw-delinquent-expression (read: punk), noise freak-outs, and songs that flourish somewhere in between. Out of the 17 tracks on <i>Songs!!!</i>, 4 of them are actual "songs" whereas the rest are varied forays into experimentalism and thrashy-noise. I appreciate the kind of fuck-you attitude it takes to populate a CD full of improv jams and psychedelic-noise-shreddery. Mess Folk will be releasing a 7" on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/horizontalaction"><u>Hozac Records</a></u> and I'm very excited about it. You should be as well (actually, I've already heard it and it's awesome).
