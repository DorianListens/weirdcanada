In the wise words of <u><a href="http://www.soulstrut.com" target="_blank">Soul Strut</a></u>... <i>MAH BACK HURTS</i>. For the past week I've been suffering some harsh back pains and it turns out I got a gang of swollen ligaments somewhere near my butt. I only tell you this so that you will understand why I haven't updated the page in the past four days. I know most of you were sleepless with speculation! I will be back and at it on Monday. Until then: medication.
