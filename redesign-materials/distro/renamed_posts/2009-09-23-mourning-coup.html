Mourning Coup's yet to be released <i>Light House</i> is a private mystery; intrigue leading unto intimacy. From it's intricate, precious packaging (that's fabric and three types of paper you see there) to the tethered mix of single-mic'd vocals, samples, drums, and keyboards, there is a prevailing sense of blurred closeness. Deservedly so, as I had to beg Chandra Melting Tallow, the creative force behind Mourning Coup, to send me a copy (1 of 5) having convinced her that ideas trump all and therefore her rough recordings will suffice. Mourning Coup will certainly join the ranks of master Canadian etherealites like <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/katiestelmanis" target="_blank">Katie Stelmanis</a></u> with her flowing, ghostly echoes; calls from a reality she's transcended and tucked between our collective consciousness. Chandra returns from India in 2010 and we will all wait patiently.
