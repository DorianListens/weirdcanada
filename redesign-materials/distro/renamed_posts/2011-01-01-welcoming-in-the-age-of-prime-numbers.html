Hi Everyone,

A <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_(number)" target="_blank">prime year</a></u> is upon us, making 2011 a year of renewal. A rebirth into the digital vortex that is our modern culture. It's going to be an exciting year. In 2011 you can expect:

- Greater penetrating into the depths of fringe minutiae.
- Six new sections for your micro-digestive pleasure.
- An <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/calendar" target="_blank"><u>event calendar</a></u> (still in beta) to help your overwhelmed and under-organized existence make it through the weekend. 
- A top 10 of some-sorts.
- New contributors and new interns to bring a greater number of oddities to your desktop.
- A redesign of the website.
- Another <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/wyrd" target="_blank">Wyrd</a></u> breaking into a new province (possibly two).
- Two interactive databases to assist bands in booking tours.
- Weird Canada in new formats.
- Whatever else we come up with along the way.

2010 was a year of huge growth for Weird Canada. This would not have been possible without you. I don't mean this in the lazy "thanks to everyone for support" way. I really mean this. Growth would not have been possible without all the word of mouth, excitement, praise, and sharing of our content. It's a very big deal to myself and everyone involved every time you make a hyperlink to the site. Or every time you talk about it on your radio show. Or in your own blog, newspaper, or zine. Or every time you tell a friend. <b>Every link makes us stronger</b>. With this in mind, I want to thank:

- All my contributors.
- Every single person who sent me or a contributor an e-mail with praise and support.
- Every band and label that sent me or one of our contributors their music.
- Every band and label that created links for their write-ups and spread them around.
- Every person who paid, danced, and enjoyed a show put on by Weird Canada or by any fringe band across Canada.
- Every single person who interacted with the site in a positive way.

I'm really looking forward to 2011. Thank you so much.

Hearts,
