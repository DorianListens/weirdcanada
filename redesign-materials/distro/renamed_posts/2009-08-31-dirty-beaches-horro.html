Somewhere deep within the Montreal subway system lurks the one-man-chamber that is Dirty Beaches. I say "deep" because I cannot imagine <i>Horror</i> being recorded outside of some disturbing corner previously forgotten by civil servants and hobos. Harking back to the cavernous solitude of Arthur Russell, <i>Horror</i> departs from the reverb-bellowing to relish in minor-key melodica and hazy room-scapes. Anyone who has ever picked up a melodica has wanted to make this record. They've also realized how difficult it is to actualize these sounds; invitational rhythms to a ruptured dystopia built on echo and cosmic background radiation. You could play this in the most horrific and terrible place on earth and we'd still be curious enough to bare the environment just to see what's going on.
