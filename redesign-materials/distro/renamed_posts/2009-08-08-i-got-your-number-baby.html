The first time I got close to another women (during our junior-high dance) I went for a butt-grab. I was twelve. She told me she had to go to the bathroom and never returned. The confusion hanging in the air post-grab-pre-rejection would have been the perfect foreground for the Silly Kissers' new adventure into vintage summer-of-'84 teenage angst. Six months after they dropped <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/06/theres-no-love-in-space/"><u>Love Tsunami</u></a>, their take on the more danceable side of '84, the Silly Kissers return with a thoughtful, less sugary, and more interesting segue into the unchartered waters of extreme-catchiness and mid-80s radio-faire. They depart from the Human League standard and set-course towards a more emotional and distorted take on '80s-balladry. The rapid key-scales and spoken-word segways are still there, so you know it's the same band of creative sailors on a quest for some higher understanding of pop. The new album is a grower and it's blowing up my spot right now. I love it.
