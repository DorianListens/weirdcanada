<b>From the stalagmite-riddled collection of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mammothcaverecordings" target="_blank"><u>Paul K Lawton</a></u></b>:<br>
Tough going for any band that automatically assumes the rank of â€œsupergroupâ€, especially when only one member of said band is in group of international renown (band in question: <a hef="http://www.myspace.com/womenmusic" target="_blank"><u>Women</a></u>, who currently hold rank of â€œbiggest band in Calgaryâ€, though they would all be pretty embarrassed if you brought that up in polite conversation). For those paying attention to the (at times) white-hot Calgary music scene, the other two members of Friendo hail from noted groups <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/07/pubescent-tarnation/" target="_blank"><u>Puberty</a></u> (on hiatus until further notice) and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/beijaflor" target="_blank"><u>Beija Flor</a></u>. Like the best groups that achieve rank of â€œsuperâ€, Friendo retain the elements that make all respective groups compelling in the first place â€“ the swirling, lo-fidelity soundscapes of Women (though, like Women, this is a warm and crisp lo-fidelity), the angular-yet-soft abrasion of Puberty and the gentleness and sense of melody of Beija Flor. <i>Cold Toads</i> could very easily be a lost K-Records release, the recording of these songs giving them a timeless-yet-dated feel, where you canâ€™t help but feel like youâ€™ve already fallen in love with these songs and they are coming back into your life at the exact right time. A stunning debut if there ever was one. <br>[<b>Levin's Note</b>: I'd like to give a big f***-you to Paul Lawton for reviewing this cassette before me. This is really blowing me away; "swirling, lo-fidelity" to say the least. And a perfect album for the cassette format. This may replace <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/07/i-cant-handle-this/" target="_blank">Sans AIDS</a></u> as my favorite 90s mellow-jam of the year. Maybe.]
