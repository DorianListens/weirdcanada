<b>From the reducible logic of <a href="http://www.mta.ca/chma/" target="_blank"><u>James Goddard</a></u></b>:
<u><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege/" target="_blank">Gottlob Frege</a></u> committed his life to one problem: demonstrating that mathematics is reducible to logic. With <i>New Problems</i> Seth Smith, takes a break from dealing with his <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/dogdaytheband" target="_blank">regular problem</a></u> to tackle some amazing new ones.  The album creates its own geometric space, a slowly unfolding shape built of tape-hiss, song fragments, actual songs and found sound. The warm strum of the guitar, the unfaithful percussive notes, and the other near constant noises consume the listener like <u><a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/DosNote.html" target="_blank">Notes From The Underground</a></u> or <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvTyBhlbWfg" target="_blank">Dreamies</a></u>.  In one particularly evocative moment Smith presents us with a crescendoing series of voice-mail messages. Ultimately, Frege died without finding the solution to his problem. Smith, on the other hand, appears to have discovered a  fruitful new direction for exploration.
