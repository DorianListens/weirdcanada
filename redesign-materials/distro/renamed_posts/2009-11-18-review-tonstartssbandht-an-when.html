<b>From the brotherly womb (?) of <u><a href="http://www.texturemagazine.ca" target="_blank">Jesse Locke</a></u></b>:
Any brother with a brother will tell you that brotherly love is some of the best love there is. Bare chested wrestling in the basement, giving each other noogies, pickin' on your little sister and <u><a href="http://www.bebo.com/c/video?FlashBoxId=4365973119&" target="_blank">pickin' boogers</a></u> from your nose are all timeless ways to have fun, but bros Andy and Edwin White have translated their sibling revelry into some of the freshest music coming out of Montreal. Alongside their military grade crew cuts, baggy white t-shirts and <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYy8FOAVMsU" target="_blank">Too $hort</a></u> pants, you can see the love in their eyes when they take the stage in either this guise or as their <u><a href="http://pukeskywalker.blogspot.com/2009/01/high-rise-psychedelic-speed-freaks-84.html" target="_blank">High Rise</a></u> tribute band, High Rise II. You can hear it in their music as well, in <i>An When</i>'s mix of trippy vocal loops, daffy raps and lo-fi loner rock, packing in 10 originals with inspired re-imaginings of Spacemen 3's "Walkin' With Jesus" and the Bambi soundtrack's "Little April Showers" (no joke!). I'd be remiss not to mention the sonic similarities Tonstartssbandht share with the Animal Collective - or maybe Panda Bear's "Bros" is a more fitting reference point - but they've carved out their own little cave in the wilderness as well and seem to be cranking out releases at the pace of Guided By Voices in their heyday. Guess the crew cuts run in the family too, 'cause that's their Dad on the cover. A+++.
[<b>Levin's Note</b>: Weird coincidence? I had this jammy bumping in my car when Jesse e-mailed me with the review. That's because Jesse and I are bros, too.]
