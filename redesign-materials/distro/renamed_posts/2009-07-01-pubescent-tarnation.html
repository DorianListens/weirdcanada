Puberty sucks. Remember that sterile, confusing, and awkward time in every person's life? Where they quickly discover just how ugly they really are. On the other hand, Puberty's incarnation as three beautiful and awkward women from Calgary is exciting, inspiring, and everything that puberty isn't. It's hard to not become affectionate with their weird concoction of post-punk jangle and water-slide slurpee pop. Every time I see them in Calgary I want to shout with glee: "the pubes!" while the drummer bashes away on cymbals and microphones. They're everyone's favorite band and why the hell not? Their unadulterated approach to punk makes me think back to my experience with puberty. Maybe bus-stop boners and B.O weren't so bad? This Live CD (#6 in an edition of 10) is pretty raw, but the sessions recorded at <a href="http://www.cjsw.com">CJSW</a> lead us in the right direction; Mac's - let's purchase cigarettes for minors and continue the trend.
