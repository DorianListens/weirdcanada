<b>From the Mithril Shields of <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
Living in Alberta, I associate Calgary with the strange angular <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOg_Eep1p5I" target="_blank">pop moves</a></u> found on <i>Cold Crystal Shield</i>. In fact, I'm starting to believe the Calgary sound is just a weird amalgamation of Montreal's pop experiments, Halifax's 90s obsession, and Yukon's cold isolation. It's all summarized brilliantly by Play Guitar with their combination of incredibly catchy guitar lines and anthemic vocal harmonies, the whole mess being driven down midnight highways and rural avenues. I say rural because I can definitely hear that 90s Halifax honky-tonk pop-rock and it's awesome. Keep your cold, crystalized eyes out for the <a href="http://theplayguitars.tk/" target="_blank"><u>Play Guitar LP</a></u>, coming soon!
