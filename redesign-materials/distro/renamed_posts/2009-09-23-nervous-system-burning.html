<b>From the musical cabinet of soon-to-be-Dr. Joni Sadler</b>:
It seems fitting to write a review of Nervous System's latest cassette at an altitude of 36,000 feet. At this moment it is still godawful early and I'm on an airplane high above the prairies. The turbulence is just rough enough to verge on unsettling and I am feeling way burnt out. In a way, "Burning White Light" is the perfect music for this scenario: careening psych freakouts equally capable of leaving you really excited or feeling a tad on edge and queasy. The fact that most of the tracks on the cassette were improvised during the recording sessions is impressive, and there's a certain recklessness that has (perhaps unsurprisingly) found its way into these songs. Pounding repetitive drums lay down a solid backbone for swaths of wailing fuzz and occasional shouts from singer/guitarist Mat Oxley. It's all coated with a heavy layer of distortion for good measure. The centerpiece of the album is the nine-minute epic "Freak Construction"¬ù - it's a serious stoner jam fleshed out around a burning guitar lick and given the final touch with some echoey vocal loops. This is serious mind-trip music, best experienced with your head way up in the clouds. [<b>Levin's notes</b>:  I am so into this kind of modern-psych that is so strange and poppy at the same time. <u><a href="http://www.bruisedtongue.com/" target="_blank">Bruised Tongue</a></u> is really killing it these days!]
