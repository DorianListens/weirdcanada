<b>From the midnight-mind of <a href="http://drewjoma.com/" target="_blank"><u>Drew Marshall</a></u></b>:
Here's a mixtape featuring some of the most radical bands in Canada that happen to be performing at the Wyrd Alberta Traveling Festival from April 30 - May 2. Each of the songs were selected from the ever-growing online database of Weird Canada reviews thanks in-large part to the inventor Aaron Levin and his worshiping gypsies. Sole proprietorship of these tracks has long since been sourced out to the general broadband public and for good reason in today's <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/bbs/viewforum.php?f=2&sid=b3ec8771020877bd290bd48355200c41" target="_blank">idea-swapping</a></u>, <u><a href="http://hypem.com/" target="_blank">music-sharing</a></u> platform of the digital revolution. And what is it all for? well, as it happens to be we find our actualization in the accumulation of bodies that come together and celebrate our eager-mindless expressions and appreciate those of others. The next great collaboration takes place in a <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/wyrd/" target="_blank">three-part series</a></u> spanning the ever-expanding, always-contracting <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRS3QJ7DdQw" target="_blank">province of Alberta</a></u> from April 30 to May 2. In preparation for this momentous occasion, I have packaged a kinetic stream of glitch-bots and odd entities to please those snow-burried souls back into oblivion. Please enjoy with severe caution. [The mix contains songs by: NÃ¼ Sensae, COSMETICS, Grand Trine, Krang, Grown-Ups, Omon Ra, Shearing Pinx, Myelin Sheaths, and Brazilian Money]
