<div class="contentReview">
Canada’s elder statesmen of ear-tickling anti-traditionalism have been a national treasure for nigh on five decades. Deriving their name and modus operandi from the found object <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm_band" target="_blank">street orchestras</a> of New Orleans, the NSB has been tirelessly jamming (almost) every Monday since the late 1960s on a motley selection of modified noise makers. <em>Nothing Is Forever</em> proves definitely that they’ve dipped into the fountain of youth, as this four-song slab from Wintage finds the band sounding as mirthful as ever. The immortal foghorn of Bill Exley booms down from the pulpit, once again setting the stage for Art Pratten’s free-squealing “Pratt-A-Various” and the <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=uUeAl6ledso" target="_blank">Sharrockified</a> moves of guitarist Murray Favro. John Clement slides in on his fretless, three-string bass passed down by the late, great <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=KUJ2rJhddxE" target="_blank">Hugh McIntyre</a>, while John Boyle tosses in a kitchen drawer of percussion and well-timed cymbal splashes. Longtime adoptee Aya Onishi gets her time to shine on the instrumental title track, letting loose with a deluge of extraterrestrial squiggles on oversized kazoo. In the end, Exley sums it all up with a plainspoken credo: “Music is hard work. You must practice day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.”
