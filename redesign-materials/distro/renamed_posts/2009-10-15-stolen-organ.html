<b>From the xian-beehive K-Mart closet of <a href="http://www.texturemagazine.ca" target="_blank"><u>Jesse Locke</a></u></b>:<br>
It'd be pretty dim to call 'em Proggy, but with their multiple movements, tempo changes and quickly shifting moods, the tweaked, twangy tunes of the Stolen Organ Family Band come across like some backwoods strain of Bohemian Rhapsody. Lyrically, singer, songwriter and six-string slinger Conor Mack shares campfire stories of shitty hometowns, divorce and excitable puppies with syrupy sweet choruses that'll get wedged in your brainpan and rattle around for weeks. With back-up vocals, blown-out Casio FX and suitcase percussion by the lovely Miss Kelly Badger plus the Zen-like steadiness of bassist Ari Cipes, the Stolen Organs bring to mind Jonathan Richman and his Modern Lovers slumming it as subway buskers. You might also think of the Meat Puppets when you're listening to these country-fried home-recorded rambles, but the shadow of the almighty Ween looms the largest. <i>Horse Treats</i> is a kind of 'greatest hits so far', and the manifesto on the back might just say it best: "Ain't down with hiss, ain't down with this."
[<b>Levin's Note</b>: Never underestimate the power of Casio.]
