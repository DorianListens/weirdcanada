Eleven thirty-second art-punk anthems straddling a thin-line between no-pop and art-wave (it would have been a lot less interesting for me to say "no-wave and art-pop," so deal with it). Take ex-<a href="http://www.myspace.com/markbirtlesproject"><u>Mark Birtles Project</u></a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thewolfnote"><u>Wolfnote</u></a> members and put them through the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thehomosexuals"><u>Homosexuals</u></a>' school of everything-under-a-minute rock-anthemy as taught by Devo. You might be close. There's nothing frivolous and only the good art is spared. It's music; to the point. They obviously have a sense of humour, but the not the kind that gives you the "no" feeling. Bayonets!!! give me a "yes" feeling.
