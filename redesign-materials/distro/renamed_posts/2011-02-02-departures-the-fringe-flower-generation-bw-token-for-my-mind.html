When you hit the minute mark, "Token For My Mind" will push you through a rumbling weave of lysergic silk that blurs your vision. Part their mystic veil and face the incumbent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindbender_(Galaxyland)" target="_blank">Mindbender</a> brilliantly placed between janglic shards of hazy vocals and militant drums. We will all submit to the new wave of refracted beings lead by Toronto's The Fringe. Hailed by Quality Records as "Canada's No. 1 Recording Group", The Fringe's entry into Canada's psychedelic scene was bold and well-matched by their second single and unreleased EP. They subsequently broke-up, leaving a small but renown legacy. Despite the heavy Jurassic Park vibes permeating "Flower Generation", it could have been a huge pop hit and was even covered by <a href="http://fivebucksonbytor.blogspot.com/2006/07/wayne-versage.html" target="_blank">Wayne Versage</a> on his solo LP. A must grip for those interested in any form of mind expansion.
