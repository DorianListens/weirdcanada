<b>From the cave-dwelling hive-mind of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mammothcaverecordings" target="_blank"><u>Paul Lawton</a></u></b>:
This xmas I got a Peace for Bombs CDR and a book outlining the history of Wowbam Records label directly from the source, Jeff King, who writes and releases music under a legion of pseudonyms and (fake) band names (though <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thesquarewaves" target="_blank"><u>The Square Waves</a></u> and <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/favourrock" target="_blank">Favour</a></u> have been his most well-known, mainly because he has actually assembled musicians to play those songs in a live setting). The <u><a href="http://www.wowbamrecords.com/?i=releases" target="_blank">Wowbam discography</a></u> is remarkable – 31 releases over ten years, ranging from noise, to punkrawk, to straightpop; a catalogue that features some astonishing works such as the Folk 6 collection that spans seven discs and 300 songs (!).  With the newest Wowbam release, Peace for Bombs, King plays secret hit-maker working within his limitations, six anthemic songs built around that shitty-drum setting you found on every <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUx7ax62OBo" target="_blank">toy-keyboard in the 80’s</a></u> and layers of synths and guitars that gives this lost classic feel - one that no one has heard, but everyone has heard-about.
[<b>Levin's Note</b>: "Anthemic" is an understatement.]
