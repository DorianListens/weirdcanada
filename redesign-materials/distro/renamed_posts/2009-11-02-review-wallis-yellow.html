Bowling: the sport of burnt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadhead" target="_blank"><u>deadheads</a></u> and psychedelic journeypersons littering every dead-end street and alley-way available. Fact: there are no bowling lanes in Victoria. Thus, without a central force attracting <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/?attachment_id=1093" target="_blank"><u>acid-casualties</a></u> and other tailings of any healthy psychedelic mise-en-scÃ¨ne, it's surprising to find the summery-yet-somber lysergic melodies of My Friend Wallis emerging from Canada's retirement wasteland. My Friend Wallis is the creative vice of Cyrstal Dorval and <i>When the Blue Turned Yellow</i> is the result of a Pacific Ocean beach party sans hobos, shenanigans, skatepark heros, and trashy tourists; a peak-of-dusk serenity when the whole world is easy on the eyes and every ukulele-strum, delayed vocal, and marimba shake brings us closer to tomorrow's hangover-mistake. It's beautiful, dreamy, ethereal, and every other word used to adjectate breezy summer evenings. So maybe it's not surprising they come form a city without bowling lanes.
