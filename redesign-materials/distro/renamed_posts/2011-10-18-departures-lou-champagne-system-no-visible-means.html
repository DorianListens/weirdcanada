<div class="contentReview">
The only way to survive living in the yuppie void of Oakville, Ontario is by burying your head deep in the intoxicating sands of imagination. For <a href="http://www.louchampagnesystemsinc.com/index.html" target="_blank">Lou Champagne</a> this meant filling his nose with the sting of solder, his eyes with a labyrinth of circuits, his mind with resistors and his ears with a virtual synthtopia of Cabaret Voltaire, The Human League, Chrisma and their analog ilk. Lou’s ‘Champagne System’ is a self-invented device that allows him to control his synths with his guitar so that he can perform as a modern day (pre-MIDI) one-man-band. The beast born of his engineering explorations, <i>No Visible Means</i>, sounds at times like a <a href="http://gristleizer.com/" target="_blank">gristleized</a> Swell Maps, at others like despondent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqEtqrtz8Cw" target="_blank">Transparent Illusion</a> produced by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEXZc3MWaP0&feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">Rago & Farina</a>. Although Lou’s vision is viewed through singular <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiygJUiQ8V4&feature=related" target="_blank">Chrome</a> & Cristal glasses there is something in these songs that is familiar to anyone who turned to art, music and dreaming to escape the boredom of growing up surrounded by numb suburban slump. Lou’s words are just as true now as they were in 1981, “I’m like a man in a fantasy, and maybe I should just get stoned”. Throw your glass in the fireplace and gulp Lou’s brew straight from the bottle; legit reissue available from <a href="http://medical-records.org/releases/" target="_blank">Medical Records</a>.
