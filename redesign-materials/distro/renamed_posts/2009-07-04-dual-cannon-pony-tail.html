The heaviest dance music on earth is composed live with pedals and samplers by this dual-pony-tailed Vancouverite performing under the elusive HolzkÃ¶pf moniker. Originally from Saskatoon, HolzkÃ¶pf's ghetto-techno took years to craft into its current state (spending some time in Edmonton in the process); a blend of harsh noise, lo-fi, and improvised tech. It's really something you need to see and hear live, but this two-track CDR contains the best recordings I've heard of his work to date (for his dancey stuff). Layers of distorted tape-squeal hover above truncations of drum loops programmed on the fly by HolzkÃ¶pf as he takes the mic and screams into DIY-fischerprice-dom. The reggie-fused  <i>I'd Be A Fool (Isolation Dub)</i> is a definite favorite. Does it get any better than a no-bit quantized dancehall riff? 

The MP3s I've posted are super low-quality (96kbs) as the files were too big. You should support HolzkÃ¶pf on his Canadian tour and pick up a CD when he comes to your town! He is definitely one of the best live performances I've ever seen!
