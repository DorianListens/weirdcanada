In the 70s <a href="http://waxidermy.com/2006/01/13/kenneth-higney-attic-demonstration/">Kenneth Higney</a> sold his big-rig to release one of the strangest downer-rock adventures the private-press universe has to offer. Thankfully, The Pink Noise share no audible similarities to Higney other than the enunciation and cadence of the singers voice. This resemblance is a positive, albeit strange aspect of the Montreal trio and it's exciting to hear that style of singing over beds of distorted, disjoint drum patterns, eerie organs, and busted guitar lines (instead of the wasted hard-rock riffery of Higney's <i>Attic Demonstration</i>). This is The Pink Noise's third release and shows them shifting from the weird-punk interpretation of the 80s minimal synth scene into a bizzare lo-fi cabaret of the wyld. From meandering, reverb-drenched lollygagging to reggae laced post-punk. It's warbly, it's warm, and it's wonderful. Canada needs more imaginative figures like The Pink Noise.
