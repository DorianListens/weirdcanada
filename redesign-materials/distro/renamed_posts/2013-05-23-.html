    <p>No lies: the first physical testament from all-female trio Lié is a slab of midwinter <a href="http://www.sciencepoles.org/assets/uploads/articles_images/permafrost_crosssection_or.jpg">permafrost</a>. The temperature in Vancouver rarely drops below freezing; Lié compensate with blackened punk aggression and icy gothic elegance. &ldquo;Fossoyeur&rdquo;&rsquo;s bassline grabs your pelvic bones and shakes them to a rhythm banged out by shovels on casket lids. And if the <a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/delphicoracle/g/DelphicOracle.htm">Delphic Oracle</a> broke curfew, started <a href="http://www.mamapedia.com/article/advice-on-pre-dash-teen-daughter-tick-s-desire-for-black-nail-polish">painting her nails black</a> and formed a band, she would sing lead on &ldquo;Muse.&rdquo; It all ends with the nicotine-jittery &ldquo;Pressure&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Overtime&rdquo;&rsquo;s feedback loop of paranoia. Word is that the Vancouver edition of this tape is sold out, so if you want a meatspace copy you&rsquo;ll have to order it from Lié&rsquo;s US label. But it&rsquo;s totally worth it for a trip into the heart of the darkness this trio conjures. Beware of black ice.</p>
