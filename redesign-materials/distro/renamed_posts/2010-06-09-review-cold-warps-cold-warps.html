<b>From the pure-pop-for-now-people hook-factory of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mammothcaverecordings" target="_blank"><u>Paul Lawton</a></u></b>:
Brilliant <u><a href="http://singsingrecords.blogspot.com/2009/07/modern-minds-theresas-world-bw-bungalow.html" target="_blank">AM radio power-pop</a></u> that is spot on in so many ways: the songs are simple, the production timeless, the guitar solos sparse, and the back-ups economical. Absolutely nothing is spared; everything cleaned and sacrificed at the alter of the almighty hook. I don’t want to hear <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWN-adiDNtM" target="_blank">power-pop that doesn’t have hooks</a></u>, and this tape has enough hooks to deprive you from sleep. There is a charming innocence here, and I’m excited to hear where they take the canon they've learned here.
