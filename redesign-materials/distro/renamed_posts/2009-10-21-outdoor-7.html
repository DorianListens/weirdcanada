Are you ready? Because anthemic rock rarely ignites the sing-a-long factory while retaining imagination and granularity within the recorded zone. Which is why <i>Twelve Hundred Dollars</i> has been an anthem to every ear lucky enough to capture its brief life on the <u><a href="http://www.thehydeaway.org" target="_blank">Hydeaway</a></u> Winter 2008 compilation. Re-recorded and released as a 7" via Edmonton's <u><a href="http://www.popecho.com" target="_blank">Pop Echo Records</a></u>, <i>Twelve Hundred Dollars</i> retains every ounce of arm-swinging, <u><a href="http://radio3.cbc.ca/bands/THE-VERTICAL-STRUTS" target="_blank">vertical strutting</a></u>, no-money bravado as ever, and dammit, it's still the biggest anthem to every rent-paying, cheapskate jerkoid who sneaks into shows, crowd-surf's their unwilling friends, and steals 5-cent candies. They've paired <i>Twelve Hundred Dollars</i> with <i>Keep Me Warm</i>, segueing the Outdoor Miners into driving 90s popfuckery matched seamlessly by Alec Meen's searing guitar leads and their iconic vocal recordings (drenched beautifully in distortion and reverb). Everybody: pay your rent!
