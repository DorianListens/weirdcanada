Two years ago Damage laid this collection on me and I somehow only got to it recently, reflecting on the need to stem the tide of things COMING INTO my zone. I’ve written about his Industrial band Phycus <a href="http://theeouternet.blogspot.com/2009/05/where-theres-smoke-theres-phycus.html" target="_blank">over at Thee-Outernet</a>, and <i>Early Electronic Works (1983-1988)</i> collects releases made during those years under the name Data Strangler in <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2011/05/final-departures-brian-damage-early-electronic-works-1983-1988/tarsandsfromair/"http://weirdcanada.com/?attachment_id=7334" rel="attachment wp-att-7334" target="_blank">Sydney, Nova Scotia</a>. Damage claims he was trying to combine Judas Priest <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT_iqsDdGgk> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNOlk_7FfFA" target="_blank">Men Without Hats</a>, a sort of Canadian teen alchemy, but the results on the early version of “Refrigerators” sounds more like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhOuIB_3cos" target="_blank">Red Krayola</a> to me. So much brilliance here: an amazing basement vibe (apparently tracks were bounced between boomboxes and you can pretty much hear the wood panelling), crude synth punk, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurizio_Bianchi" target="_blank">MB style</a> electronic miniatures, synth pop, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kember" target="_blank">Kemberic</a> tremolo’d organ zones and so on. Damage’s songcraft is tight and he employs a varité approach to his lyrics which at times are hilarious (“Big Man On Campus”), creepy (“Refrigerators”), tragi-comedic (“Tar Pond Monster”) and cyberpunkish “(Malfunction 54”). Here are two mp3s, but I imagine this is getting the wax treatment sooner than later.
