<b>From the flat-broke pockets of <a href="http://www.weirdcanada.com/" target="_blank"><u>Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:
The immense planning that entailed <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/wyrd/" target="_blank">Wyrd Fest</a></u> resulted in a deep, sexual relationship between myself and <a href="http://weirdcanada.com/2009/07/turbo-future/" target="_blank"><u>Wicked Awesomes!</a></u> guitar-player Tyler. During one of our many <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Wyrd_Fest-Tickets.jpg" target="_blank">Magic-ticket-making</a></u> missives, he looked in my eyes and whispered: "Aaron, have you heard our bass player's solo project?" That was my first foray into the wildly contagious world of Brazilian Money. Fast-forward a month and I finally have some "official" recordings. It was sudden impact: vocalist-and-everything-else-as-well Garret's grizzled nasal, his omnifarious pop-filtrations, and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7V6gITreRA" target="_blank"><u>swampy</a></u> sensations ensnaring every ear-movement. I was knocked-out, surprised and excited by the EP's stranglehold. Thankfully, with every listen came newly rewarding energies. A recommended soundtrack for the shower (replacing my current shower favorite: Mobb Deep's <i><u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxIZzTU53Ag" target="_blank">Tha Infamous</a></u></i>). Sing along and get clean, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCil-kLGkvc" target="_blank"><u>mayne</a></u>.
