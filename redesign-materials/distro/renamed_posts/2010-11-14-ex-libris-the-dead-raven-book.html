<b>From the creative death of <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com" target="_blank">Aaron Levin</a></u></b>:<br>
With over fifty illustrations of <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/?attachment_id=5295" target="_blank">cruel</a></u> and <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/?attachment_id=5293" target="_blank">unusual</a></u> methods to deal with the North Canadian raven scourge, <i>The Dead Raven Book</i> is your go-to guide for creative disposal. Who thought ravens could be used for shotgun holsters, candlesticks, or even <u><a href="http://weirdcanada.com/?attachment_id=5292" target="_blank">bathtub soap trays</a></u>? I certainly didn't. But Dave Particelli did. And he did so in dedication to "Heather... and the Raven who stole her lunch." Published by the obscure Type Unlimited (operating out of Yellowknife (<a href="http://weirdcanada.com/?attachment_id=5294" target="_blank"><u>1,500km from Edmonton</a></u>)) and loaned to me from the library of <u><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=my+most+favoritest+person" target="_blank">Marie Lef</a></u>. [All links above the last one contain scans from the book.]
