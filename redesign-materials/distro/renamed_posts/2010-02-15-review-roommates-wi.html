<b>From the polyamorous disaster of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Thomas-Rea-Media/169897184271?ref=share" target="_blank"><u>Michael Deane</a></u></b>:
Looking onto the mid-northern <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVmQUZgcR_U" target="_blank">thunderous tundra</a></u> puts me in a perfect place to relate to the Roommates' “Back to the Sun,” the latest in a flurry of side-projects from <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucked_Up" target="_blank">Fucked Up</a></u> guitarist Ben Cook. The breezy, straightforward pop hooks tinged with melancholy and longing speak directly to me. "Back to the Sun" is self-conscious, with sun-yearning lyrics matched by the sweetly sad vocals and tom-heavy thumping we're used to from <u><a href="http://www.myspace.com/younggovernor" target="_blank">Young Governor</a></u>. The flip of this cassingle is the slightly creepy, slightly goofy anthem that follows two dudes trying to talk their gals into a “Girlfriend Swap”. Infectious hooks and an entertaining story-line make it repeatable power pop magic. “Don't roll your eyes at me / Let's do things differently / We're all just one big family / So let's give it a try.” I'm not quite convinced by their logic, but you can't deny these hits.
[<b>Levin's Note</b>: I'm <i>very</i> convinced. Hit me on my beeper.]
