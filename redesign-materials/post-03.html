					<h1>Music and Musicians and The Digital Revolution</h1>
				</div>
				<p>Over the last decade or so, there has been much ballyhoo regarding the strange death of recorded music sales. Brian Eno and Mick Jagger, for example, have claimed the Glory Days of selling records are over. According to these icons (and supreme beneficiaries) there was a brief window somewhere between the mid-1960s and early 1990s in which musical artists could make a decent living from their recordings. But that window is firmly closed now. The staying power of digital music and the ease with which it is disseminated and consumed has created a new paradigm in which making a living of any kind, let alone becoming wealthy from selling records, is a non-starter for most artists. For many, simply breaking even on production costs is a pipe-dream. Some have blamed the change on the bald callousness of people downloading their favourite music for free. Some have seen it as basic ‘supply and demand’ economics. And there is nothing if not a stunning, completely overwhelming supply of music available to us today.</p>

				<p>It is tempting to bemoan this new landscape that seems to favour the listener at the expense of the artist. With outlets like YouTube, Rdio, and Pandora raking in millions of dollars, capitalizing on people’s thirst for music, while sharing very, very little of their revenue with those who provide the content, it isn’t hard to find something to complain about.</p>

				<p>Indeed, streaming offers a great boon for music fans but little compensation for artists. Once upon a time, you had to buy a record to decide if you liked it or not. If you didn’t, too bad for you. You could take it to the used record store or throw it out. Now, free samples are par for the course. In fact, the free samples often feel like the product itself much of the time. Paying for music is an option only those with sympathetic hearts will choose. This has left a lot of working artists struggling to create their art and asking themselves big questions about why they do what they do (and you might argue this is a good thing).</p>

				<p>The picture looks bleak. It really feels like Eno and Jagger are right. But it is not going away. What once seemed like an anomaly that might have been fixed with greater law enforcement and litigation is now the undeniable norm. And while some musicians will find money in ad placements or film scores and some will be fortunate enough to make real money touring (which, despite what you may have heard, is not the simple alternative to selling records), for the vast majority of musicians, the pure satisfaction of making music with your pals will have to suffice.</p>

				<p>And for lots of people it does. No matter its package, music persists. People still create it and perform it with as much passion and dedication as ever. Maybe more than ever, as there seems to be an exponential growth in the amount of music we can access.</p>

				<p>While it might have ruined the way musicians made livings for the past forty years, the digital revolution has not ruined music. Instead, it has ushered in an entirely new era in the history of musical consciousness, like the lacquer channel and radio before it.</p>

				<p>Michael Chanan pointed out, in his mind-blowing book Repeated Takes, that the invention of recorded music fundamentally changed how human beings interacted with and interpreted music. Before you could record music, and thereby freeze a moment in time, if you weren’t physically present you missed it. Period. But the advent of modern recording technology created a context wherein the vast majority of its listeners weren’t anywhere near the music when it was performed. Not being physically present was no longer a barrier. This was more than a technological sea change. It fundamentally changed how we interpreted and interacted with music. It turned what had been a purely ephemeral experience into something you could hold in your hands and take home with you. And once you could hold it your hands, you could trade it for some money. Boom! The record industry was born.</p>
				<aside class="pull">Not being physically present was no longer a barrier. This was more than a technological sea change.</aside>

				<p>In essence, for music to retain its intrinsic value on a human scale, beyond the definitions the marketplace has given it, we need to formulate new ways to articulate its value in our lives so that those who create the music we love can sustain themselves and benefit from our interest.</p>
				<p>But now, that physical artefact is a minor detail. People still buy CDs but not as many. They don’t need to. Virtually everything is available whenever we want it. The sheer expanse of musical choices is mind-boggling. Anyone can record a song, put it in a digital bottle and push it off into the vast ocean of ones and zeros. Digital music, in all its ubiquity, has become an integral part of our daily lives. It has become just like the personal devices we use to enjoy it: intimately woven into our culture in a profoundly unremarkable way. It is like air. We need, value, and appreciate it, but we hardly ever think of it. We are in it but it’s not in the front of our minds. Its meaning has been obliterated. Digital music has become fully ‘decommodified’. It is no longer a unit of material production to be bought and sold.</p>

				<p>Heavy.</p>

				<p>But also pretty liberating. If you believe, as I do, that capitalism is not the only (and certainly not the best) way to organize our selves, then unshackling art from its marketplace chains is kind of appealing. But then how does the musician survive? How does one make a living from one’s art?</p>

				<p>In his book Noise: The Political Economy of Music, Jacques Attali argued there have been four stages of musical history. The first was the era of unwritten, purely oral music. The second was the era of printed music. The third was the era of recorded music. Attali wrote Noise in 1977, which was, in his estimation, the beginning of a fourth stage. Attali worried that the transformation of music into something merely to be consumed threatened its relevance and meaning in our lives. With technology breaking down old modes of communication and thereby stunting our relationships with one another, he urged us to “create our own relation with the world and try to tie other people into the meaning we create.” Commodifying music, he felt, could only lead to its degeneration of meaning and value in society. Fetishizing so powerful a social force in the lives of human beings would obscure its true function.</p>

				<p>We all know art has an inherent value that cannot be described strictly in economic terms. And the connotations of calling it a ‘hobby’ are derogatory. In essence, for music to retain its intrinsic value on a human scale, beyond the definitions the marketplace has given it, we need to formulate new ways to articulate its value in our lives so that those who create the music we love can sustain themselves and benefit from our interest. Doing this successfully could create a boon in ways for artists to thrive. It could open new streams of compensation for artists and their work. Crowdsourcing and other such things are good starts but we need to get far more creative. More radical ideas like making art a human right or designating artists as public servants, with state-funded stipends, would be even better. But it can go much further than this.</p>

				<p>I know this sounds like some Commie-Socialist Utopianism but it really comes down to how we value art in our lives. If we accept that only professionals should be paid well and those who aren’t paid are amateurs or hobbyists then we are accepting a false hierarchy dictated by the market and consumer-corporate thought. It insinuates that the work done by unknown artists is inferior or less serious and therefore less worthy of support. But music’s true value has always resided in the local, in the communities where it flourishes and adds substance to people’s daily lives. This isn’t to say that someone in rural Finland can’t enjoy Jay Z, but people like him represent only the tip of the iceberg, the 1% if you will. The other 99% of the berg of musical activity consists of local bands, songwriters and the like of whom the majority of people in the world will never hear of.</p>

				<p>However, the Digital Revolution has muted the demarcation lines of consumerism and made it possible for formerly disparate musical communities to connect. It has thrown the machine into disarray. It is returning music to the place it occupied in human societies before the industrial revolution, before consumerism and Western cultural hegemony: playing for pleasure. As Attali put it, playing purely for pleasure, “relates to the emergence of the free act, self-transcendence, pleasure in being instead of having.” And not pleasure in the hedonistic sense either. The pleasure of the moment, the pleasure of simply ‘being’. And this important. As philosopher Erich Fromm argued, an emphasis on ‘having’ over ‘being’ turns us into a myopic lot and sends us down the road to arrogance, ignorance and, ultimately, disintegration.</p>

				<p>Music, therefore, could be the wellspring of a new global attitude; a loosening of commercial restraints and, ultimately perhaps, the alternative solution to social organization the world needs so desperately.</p>

				<p>The goals of fame and fortune are antiquated. Doing social media better or touring more are not adequate solutions because they do not address the fundamental changes that have taken place. Touring more is cost prohibitive and an endeavour that has traditionally been supported by record sales. And the battle to get people to pay for music has been lost. Trying to force people to pay for it or scold them for not are attempts to put the ketchup back in the bottle: a futile exercise with limited benefit. Instead, we need to take a longer view, to see beyond commerce. Musicians need to make a living, everyone does, but bemoaning the collapse of record sales will not bring the Glory Days back.</p>

				<p>The sheer immensity of exponential information growth we are now experiencing is staggering. And that vast ocean of data is challenging our modes of perception and interpretation. Artists and musicians risk being drowned out in the din of digital noise unless they can build new ways of creating value from their work, of finding new ways of building audiences and communicating their ideas. Art is of central importance in the lives of human beings. This is undeniable. That the fundamental ways the human brain interacts with information has been forever altered is also undeniable. Only solutions that speak to this revolution will situate the artist to live and flourish in the Exponential Age.</p>
